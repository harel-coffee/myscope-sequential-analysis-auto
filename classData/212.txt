121	cg: i think it'll work if i put it in progress i think it'll work for us
122	cg: yeah i think she'll follow
123	cg: yeah i buy thing and they i i don't know if it just the period of time that we choos to eat is what hinder us becaus i buy the healthi thing i buy the littl blueberri i buy the plain cereal and i buy the yogurt and i buy all that i i just don't understand what it is
124	cg: yeah and like even they said the can stuff has like preserv i stop buy everyth can i buy fresh or frozen now and i'll cook that now a coupl of week ago i just start her to eat celeri she never like the celeri so we got like some littl spread stuff and put on that so she'll tri that now i don't know

126	cg: that inaud and do these two
127	cg: and then i would come home and she would order pizza it her and her brother she would order a whole box of pizza some breadstick some wing or someth i mean one or the other is enough
128	cg: i think she can i don't think she necessarili have to stop i just think she need to learn portion control of it like someth happen a few month ago where someon said someth to her in school and she never told me that they said it but i notic in her behavior and her pattern that somebodi said someth to offend her so she start come home she would eat less of this i said "well kara i cooked" "no i'm not go to eat noth today i'm go to eat tomorrow" or "no i'm go to do this" or "no i'm go to do that" and then she start work out and that anoth thing we have stuff at home to work out on we'll put the cloth on it or we'll someth
129	cg: i think i just need to to just enforc thing more
130	cg: yeah but i think i just need to work more harder in in show her how to do thing right and i know myself i need to lead by exampl and they will follow and all that and so i just need to start on my own
131	cg: i mean we talk but she confid more in my mother and my friend than she do with me i don't i don't know whi is that becaus i told her she can tell me anyth and with her come home feel the way she do i don't want her to feel that way becaus she overweight and that a concern to me and that how most kid start with the bulimia and all that type of stuff i don't want her to go through that so i just need to chang me in order to chang her
132	cg: i'm veri confid i did it befor i lost a hundr pound just last year
133	cg: then i went through a coupl depress and i start my eat so she saw me actual put it in progress and she saw the weight and everyth fall off but i don't want it to be like oh i don't want it to be a rush thing for either one of us i want us to just take it gradual and just put thing in step
134	cg: and not just take it off and then it come back doubl inaud
135	cg: she too big
136	cg: not like i get more upset when she steal food that when that when it bother me becaus usual what she steal inaud like i said i have five kid she the oldest of five so everybodi like certain thing and she'll say she want certain thing and when i buy her certain thing she eat her stuff and then when her stuff is gone she in their stuff and then when i say what happen she like act like she didn't never know it even exist so that is like when i kind of say someth to her whatnot probabl go off but just like on a regular basi no i mean i have but
137	cg: right becaus befor the two babi it was three of them so if i buy someth with six you onli entitl to two mayb one if i happen to want someth out of that six and she'll go through five or all the six and i'm like "what made you think they was all yours" ? you know what i'm say everybodi is here and so
138	cg: i mean if she was interest in someth i wouldn't have a problem like my nine year old he is-eight year old-wel yeah my nine year old so my nine year old in karat he in swim he in baseball-basketbal that just his summer he alway been in karat 24/7 my eight year old is in swim and that all he care about is swim other than swim he roller blade he go to skateboard camp they'r activ and they'r activ on their own i don't encourag i don't discourag but my eight year old is also a nerd like when school in he like oh they got a book club they got a social club they got a volunt club so he all over everywher all the time and he just stay busi on his own i don't you know like oh you should pick up a book and read it i don't
139	cg: right then i support it right i get up and i take him to swim practic and
140	cg: i was just tell my friend right i was just tell my friend like they have famili swim on wednesday and friday i said he alway bring the babi i want to swim with the babi and i said he have us in the water so much i don't even want to take a bath i said i'll take a shower but i don't want to sit in ani other water becaus i'm sit in water all day i don't want to see no water i don't want to drink no water laugh you know but if he want us to come then we come now she will go swim with us but she doesn't swim she get in the water i have an eight month old and a 17 month old so she kind of play with a babi in the water but she doesn't like swim and get like some physic activ go on so i mean and that
141	cg: yeah and she will go but

294	cg: both yeah both just it just like i think like bring her here what i was hope to get from from from her here-becaus she want to lose weight too she realli do so i just i want her to know like i support her decis it not easi you know what i'm say it realli isn't easi and i'll be tri to explain that to her becaus she think if she go ride a bike then she can lay lay down and play with her ipod or get on the comput for the rest of the day no you have to constant you know what i'm say you have to be activ and you know so just kind of bring her here where she can talk to somebodi and also just to let her know like okay you know you can do it but it it it take you know it not easi you know you have to chang a lot of thing in your eat habit and even if i do have to you know even if there is someth at home that you know is not good for you you'r still go to have to make an intellig decis to say i'm not go to eat this but here a banana instead of the chip i'm go to get a banana and a yogurt becaus it there you know now do i still have chip there ? yeah i do do my husband still have you know like he'll have pepsi becaus he drink pepsi but that don't mean that we have to you know what i'm say that she has to like drink it whenev so this is a lot laugh
295	cg: yeah that i'm like support of her plan of weight loss and that ani idea that we can take back to implement you know like becaus when i was do a littl research i mean the what that thing ? the question one of the thing was like you know help make sure they write down what they eat everi day and that what i did you know and so it veri effect if you write down what it is you'r eat and then also becaus it give you a chanc to think like okay should i eat this or should i put this back and get someth els ? becaus you'r write it down so yeah i think i think this will help her i hope it help her
296	cg: yeah besid it come from me becaus oftentim when it come from me it might not come in the most you know becaus i'll be like brianna you need to get up off that couch and do someth you know but mayb if somebodi you know if she can read it and it show her like okay if you get off the couch and you increas your activ becaus it not just the weight is not just go to disappear it not go to just evapor
297	cg: it take a lot of effort even when you'r tire you have to continu to go but you'll see result in the end and you'll be happi with them and that what will motiv you but oftentim get from that point start and just a littl motiv factor where you can see the scale go down you get discourag laugh realli quick

341	cg: yeah i'v done just about everyth that i realli know how to do you know and then i even like figur that i can see where i'v start i'v start gain weight kind of so we can kind of like be on the same plan becaus i know if i realli want to do someth about my weight i i could do someth about the weight twenti two pound that i need to lose i would have done someth about it but it realli doesn't becom a big deal to me becaus at least we still we'r not realli close in size but at least i'm still it like okay i still it it not it doesn't affect her as bad becaus we'r both on the plus size side of the store but i realli don't like be on the plus size side of the store and i'm realli inaud emot becaus of the fact that i just can't don't want her to be over there by herself
342	cg: no i just don't want her to feel super uncomfort at this point you understand what i'm say ?
343	cg: i kind of do like we were go to go to weight watcher but realli it like for me i had to explain to her i'm not go to pay for both of us to be on weight watcher i'll pay for you to be on weight watcher and we'll follow your plan becaus it doesn't make ani sens for me to pay to go to weight watcher for 22 pound
344	cg: but i am will to do to chang my whole hous to make sure that you know

346	cg: so she find so she find way to identifi and then like i see like when she see children who are younger than younger than her that are overweight she get realli realli emot about it becaus it like she know what they'r about to go through she doesn't want anybodi realli to go through what she go through she see that it a big she has an issu with be over 200 pound and she say that if she can get out of the 200s then she'll feel more comfort with who she is and then i feel like she'll be abl to live more she'll actual go somewher you know i have a problem an issu with her go to school onlin i just realli would like for her to actual social i would like for her to go place i would like for her you know to go place without me becaus right now she won't even go like like our church event she won't go to the church outing or anyth and it not like she doesn't realli have anybodi to identifi with she just realli isn't comfort social becaus she doesn't want anybodi to say anyth about her becaus she has a veri she realli realli nice
347	cg: like we were out of town we were at my sister hous and my sister is get marri or whatev and her stepson call her a speed ship
348	cg: it kind of got everybodi els start it start just like it just start to erupt so it went from this one littl incid to this big huge incid that it hadn't realli bother her as much becaus he was six so she you know you can't you know she 14 she doesn't get mad at a littl six year old for say someth you know mean becaus he six laugh so she balloon into someth realli big and for her it was like okay well if i wasn't like this all this wouldn't be happen
349	cg: right she alreadi
350	cg: yeah we'r at this point where someth is go to start now like becaus of the fact that she goe to school onlin we have to have some so we were go so we were go to we'r look at gym tri to figur out what the best plan for her and what she more comfort with becaus i don't want her to be in a set where she not go to be comfort becaus it just go to be a wast of our money
351	cg: so we'v got to go so we go to differ place so she she think she think she want to go to fit 19 so they have like i think like they'r open like seven to nine so she can kind of pick her point where she want to go in and becaus she goe to school onlin you know we can just go when it you know best for her
352	cg: her or my her me or her sister becaus her sister just had a babi and she like they'r both like you know right now they'r both at my daughter was like my daughter was actual a model laugh and she is like she mayb like 189 right now so she like realli go through it too so now i got the both of them laugh
353	cg: we got to we got to yeah we got to kind of group thing go on she like mom we have to do someth i can't be like this i was "do you rememb that i was a model" ? then she start take out all these pictur then my 14 year old inaud took out her pictur and now they both togeth and they'r like and so they this one she was like "well you know my sister is not comfort with her weight and she doesn't like be on the plus side and i don't want to be on the plus side either so what are we go to do" ? so laugh
354	cg: i don't know that what i need some suggest i'm not realli sure
355	cg: and actual the doctor at i was talk to i went to the doctor to get the okay to go to the gym becaus you know becaus she under 18 you have to get an okay from the doctor and then we were go to the weight watcher and then you know everyth alway say make sure you check with your doctor first so then dr inaud was like well mayb the chimney project will be someth that you'll be interest in becaus you'r alreadi like right there laugh
356	cg: actual we'r go we'r go to go to weight watcher i guess like i was kind of it doesn't make a lot of sens i watch a lot of-you know it realli doesn't make a lot of sens for me to say "okay i'm go i'm i'm i'm not comfort with your weight here laugh and you need to do someth about it" becaus that kind of make becaus me be a parent that mean that if she didn't feel uncomfort with it that would just make it veri uncomfort
357	cg: so you know she my onli child so it like she doesn't have anoth sib to go to she you know she has step-sibl but she doesn't have anybodi in the hous it just me and my grandmoth my grandmoth is 80 so so i i was just realli kind of wait for her it to be too much for her and at this point she readi to make a chang
358	cg: she readi to make a chang so if she readi to make a chang we can go ahead and start to facilit the chang becaus she readi to chang and i couldn't realli make too mani move until she was readi
359	cg: that would be good
360	cg: well actual kind of what she doe now well with her diabet when she got she said "i want to be respons for my own stuff i want to give my own shot i want to be respons for take my own blood sugar i can do this" and i said "so how are you go to keep up with these thing if you don't want me to treat you you know to do this for you" ? she said "well i'll just put an alarm i'll put an alarm on my phone" so she doe keep up with with the shot she take the shot on time she check her blood glucos so you know and then she one of these peopl she realli doesn't like anybodi to say anyth to her so she would just rather just do what need to be done in order for you not to say anyth to her she has to see the nutritionist at the diabet clinic everi three month and they do this test where you have to do this breath test and i guess it kind of show how mani calori you lose do activ and thing
361	cg: right and then one is idea and then the econom becaus my kid get bore with stuff quick 56:22 like they did karat class for a while we did it for about a good two month got bore didn't want to go back ani more so i don't want to like spend a lot of money on gym and activ and class that i know my kid are not go to go to especi demoni she'll get bore 56:34
362	cg: and she know that they are watch laugh to see if she is start to actual start the exercis she realli doesn't want anybodi to say anyth to her so she like "okay well i need to do someth so this this number will go down so they will stop say anyth to me" so those are like kind of thing for her to do and i'v actual bought her a a pedomet
363	cg: right so we'v talk about actual you know "you'r go to have to get on a schedul and if you'r not go to school physic you have a you can set a schedul and plan for yourself and you'r just go to have to kind of stick to it becaus this is your bodi and this is your life and you'r 14 and i have about four more year that i'm realli in control of you and everyth els is go to kind of be on you you know"
364	cg: becaus she like "i don't have six hamburg and i don't eat three bag of 99 cent chip at one time i don't eat drink a two liter of pop i don't you know i don't i drink i eat the same stuff that everybodi els here is eat and i don't understand whi i'm have this problem and we'r eat the same stuff" that where she at she was at she has a real thing with breakfast breakfast is a big problem for us she will skip breakfast she will not eat until 12 one o'clock and she just has not gotten it in her head that when you final do eat your bodi is go to hold onto all of this stuff becaus you are not proper feed your bodi so she just has not gotten that scienc in her head yet and if i can get that through her head we will be go somewher but i am notic that becaus i have bought i onli i buy i didn't buy they told me to make sure that whatev i had we could at least have a calori count on
365	cg: so i make sure that
366	cg: so she work within right and like when she has a sweet tooth we find these at kroger they have these like these littl snack pack that have carrot or they have appl and the appl have like a low fat carrot dip in it
367	cg: becaus right now they'r tell her it becaus her and she done realli good sinc she becom a diabet she hasn't realli gain she hasn't gain ani weight
368	cg: right so she realli control it well i think we have more issu with low blood sugar than we have with high blood sugar she doesn't have she rare take a correct dose shot that mean that her blood sugar rare goe high enough for her to actual have to take the extra insulin dose
369	cg: if she goe under if she get under 200 pound she will definit be off of the shot she'll be off of the shot
370	cg: my plan at this point is to we'r go to start weight watcher next month i'm go to tri to shop a littl differ i'v start to chang i'm just realli tri to like chang my kitchen over laugh
371	cg: right right to chang my kitchen over and
372	cg: tri differ thing like i'm tri brown rice this month and we'v never tri brown rice so i'm tri to you know just add differ thing and just tri to slowli chang
373	cg: the activ are probabl like our greatest issu we realli get if we start move with the activ i think we'll be okay i'm just tri to get her in some i just need other peopl to keep say you need to move around laugh you have to move around you have to move around you have to move around and you chang your diet but you still have to move around and
374	cg: right you have to move around and she know she you know she at that stage where she think i think i know everyth
375	cg: i'm a littl discourag at time onli becaus i can't be with her 24 hour a day and i work a ten hour shift so when i leav out of the hous at seven and come back some day she she has consum an aw amount of food so i'm pretti concern and then she i don't know if you pick up on it she veri sensit to a lot of thing but it hard for me to say "don't do that" becaus she goe into this almost semi-depress mood you know
376	cg: i yeah laugh yes i know she is so
377	cg: i'm readi to tackl this
378	cg: yeah becaus if i have idea yeah then i can switch up like we'r go to do this i got a good two month for this one you know so laugh i just need idea for differ stuff
379	cg: in far as far as snack keep snack or healthi time or ? i i actual i was tell the other young ladi that chelsea is a she like a phenomen fruit lover she we got a watermelon one day and within two day it was gone so she consum a lot of fruit she love thing like broccoli raw broccoli and thing like that but sometim it just not feasibl financi to keep it go and as afro-american it someth about we all need meat where i i work with my boss doe not necessarili need to eat meat all the time so i'v learn that that not someth that i need to do but i can't get chelsea to understand that so she doesn't think like if we have macaroni and chees as a meal she alway think i need some meat and you don't so i think i i need to work a littl bit better at tri to get her to understand becaus she kind of think that i think in mayb in the back of her mind she think that we'r pick on her or it just someth about her and she doesn't get it that i'm not pick on her it just that we realli need to handl we have a histori of diabet and heart diseas so i'm realli concern about her and i think she feel that i love her but she just can't feel that love when it come to tri to get her to understand her weight
380	cg: oh absolut with a 14 year old ? yes laugh
381	cg: yeah actual we have a lot of support from famili it just that she doe not we don't get a chanc to see them as much so she is chelsea is the heaviest out of all five five of my niec and it it make her sad so the choic that i have made is like we'll do a pasta and then but it doesn't it like i can't her to understand that you don't eat until you'r just burst you eat until you get until you feel full and then you stop so i tri to like substitut with water and i put all this water in the hous and one day i just came home and there was just water bottl everywher and i'm say what are you do ? well i'm drink the water but you'r tri to drink it all at one time laugh so you know it sometim it a doubl edg sword
382	cg: no like whole bag of donut and three four bag of dorito and it and it onli becaus i think it becaus my older daughter can physic work it off where chelsea is she stuck she not abl to exercis and when we do when i do tri to exercis with her she'll "no i don't want to walk no i don't want"-so actual i'm today actual i'm go to buy this littl it a i don't know what you want to call it it a compact stepper mayb
383	cg: well i want to get involv yeah i do i want to be involv with her we use to do someth a coupl of year ago a cowork and i had gotten some what did she call them ? she call them oh shoot she had a a phrase for overweight children we got mayb six kid and we work with them through the through the summer chelsea end up lose eight pound i was so oh my god i was so happi
384	cg: that a good question and becaus now that she two three year older she did tell me that kid get bore easili so if you be redund with the exercis and over and over they don't want to do it so we when we tri it it actual turn out that we would do differ exercis on differ day so if we met with them mayb monday wednesday and friday monday would be someth then we would switch it up on wednesday and then we would go back and do the same thing we did and it work out great and then we also had the feedback from chelsea so she would tell us "mom this work mom this doesn't work mom this suck mom this inaudible" you know it was a good idea onc we had to let it go she went back in the same routin and i had to go back to work ugh it just it more than a notion
385	cg: yeah that is a good that a good thing to think about but yeah i mean we tri to be buddy-buddi when thing come it just she and i so she depend on me for differ thing and i depend on her and it actual it could all work out it just our household is just in shambl laugh but that was one of the reason that i came down just tri to get some idea and mayb start her if if sometim when you talk to a child and it not exact you and it somebodi els it come from somebodi els they understand better and they comprehend it and they grasp it rather than hear it out of mom and make nag sound you don't know what you'r talk about
386	cg: well you can look onlin like friend who do differ thing like i just found out about a box class a friend of mine told me about which like i know they'll go until they start have to do the exercis before-that what stop the karat class you know you have to do like 100 pushup 57:34 that what kill it i'm be honest that what kill it i know that what go to kill the box class so i'm go to get two week out of that mayb laugh
387	cg: exact answer question and she you know she pick up some she the child is amaz she pick up on when she think somebodi is tri to be kind to her and other time she just i don't think they were right it was someth about that that i so
388	cg: yes if she was talk to you then she is she in good mode
389	cg: mayb like those those littl 100 calori snack
390	cg: onc the i think it the end of june the end by the end of june she has noth again until septemb so there are two month in between there and you know you can gain a lot of weight in two month do noth so i'm actual in in the process of tri to find a kick box for children i don't know if there anyth like that but that is someth that she has told me a coupl of time that she realli interest in do for more than one reason i think that she would probabl do veri well in it she a veri activ chunki child i'll call her a chunki child chunki child but also it let go of a lot of steam that she she has built up in her from whatev school day or someth and i think that would be a good thing for her so i'm actual in search of a kick box class
391	cg: oh and she love fish laugh
392	cg: but chelsea doesn't get that " mom you just bake some cookies" ! so i got it must have been like someth god was tell me becaus he broke my stove so i don't have that laugh to do anymor so i think our our we'r go to have to actual focus on tri to just go and get those raw veget i use when she was a littl toddler i would cut up all their veget and put them on the bottom of the refriger and they'd go in and grab them and keep go and i got away from that onc she got older becaus i thought that she would do it but she doesn't want to do it so we need to realli get back into some fresh veget becaus she doe fresh fruit sigh i'm i'm still tri to figur out the portion size though becaus chelsea feel like fruit fresh fruit and fresh veget are free food which they are but isn't there a limit ? laugh okay

422	cg: yeah she act like me so i don't like that crazi stuff i don't want her to do that laugh
423	cg: well it just basic you know it not as you know i had thought about it i said well at first we were like no but then but then again i'm kind of glad i did becaus this will help her to see there were a lot of stuff now that we we eat it doe harm us becaus you know when i was younger i use to love to go to some of the stuff and get all the differ the good stuff and everyth but as i realiz when i got older it wasn't realli good and you know i was talk with my doctor and he said you know a lot of the stuff that peopl do you know so mani differ thing have differ health effect and i learn that now you know that you know junk food when i was younger i use to see commerci about junk food inaud and inaud and most it i use to love but i learn now that yes it can bring a veri bad situat and so now at her age and while she young i'm kind of glad that it is teach her to show her that you know now someth you just you know it feel good to eat but it not right right you know it can harm us in a way so i kind of like mayb if i would have had the willpow mani year some year back i probabl wouldn't be as where i am now a littl heavi but i'm begin to see you know start a new strategi work with it and stuff and see how we can just chang our strategi on the nutrit and everyth i was take nutrit class when some 12 year ago
424	cg: you know that when i was pregnant with her and they was tell us you know that if we eat the way we can eat now you know when it you know when it come time to deliv you know it can kind of like you know i'm kind of like whatev you know how the babi go to know you know with the nutrit ? but she like she like veget and everyth it just that i got to work a littl harder about not have all them differ snack and this and that you know start have but it just main that the health food is good but it just by it be expens and it make it hard for other peopl to to get it but i told her i said well we'r go to tri to make a new strive at it she drink a lot of liquid fluid and stuff like that so i told her we'r go to tri a new way you know use snack fruit snack and littl differ stuff instead of you know pop chip candi and all like that becaus now i'm find out that pop can realli can hurt you you know becaus it has so much acid in it
425	cg: yeah and you know so i said okay well okay well that got to go this got to go that got to go you know and i learn and i think two day ago i wasn't realli myself so i kind of realiz there got to be someth i ate or someth to drink or mayb the way i slept or howev i was but i know i was feel realli bad mm-hmm and late you know i'v been push myself to drink you know drink a lot of water but i just ain't been and i know i should you know and everybodi is tell me you know like well "you look like you'r go down some" you know i said well i said mayb if i start back this drink you know stuff that i don't need to drink you know as much as i love tea i was told don't mess with tea laugh and i was like tea is one of the best thing in the world to me i thought tea was the best thing to drink you know and stuff but my like the research will we be abl to get a chanc to come back and see more you know do more about it ? how what the nutrit and you know stuff like that but is is it go to be just a set or is it go to be like you know have more peopl involv where they can be abl to understand the differ thing of it ?
426	cg: yeah becaus i kind of i kind of thought about ask well you know do it on your own is a littl hard but when you it like when other peopl influenc you and then you get into it it kind of like it more of a more like fun in a way but it not but as you look at it it realiti it just basic realli realiti becaus i see a lot of us that where that it doe affect in so mani way and you know they put product out here even though it for to sell it but realli it up to us how which way we take it and put it in a in a better way you know becaus i know i'll be sit up there at the store and i'll be load up we you know we be load up on pop and this and that and i said well wait a minut i said well we eat pork as it is enough certain beef meat is get kind of bad and i said well i said mayb if we just chang the way we you know cook it and stuff so i and i thought about it i said mayb if we can you know a lot of peopl they don't know how to fix differ diet stuff where they say it tast nasti but a lot of the diet food if you would fix it it realli don't tast nasti
427	cg: and i ask the ladi some year back i said mayb if y'al could get like a book get someth where they normal i like to fix someth that is nutrit like a lone littl book that got littl recip and stuff in there that could kind of like help help a lot of them you know becaus a lot a lot of them ain't go to get up off their good cooki good chip and good you know stuff but now i also notic that they know you have them but it the sodium that was in it that we got to stay away from becaus we are i notic myself i am addict to that sodium all the differ type of sodium that they has the pop the chip oh the chocol you know stuff that i know that you know you be want but then again it not it not realli good so mm-hmm and i kind of said and i kind of thought about it i said well mayb you know they got them but i thought about it in month sinc i said well mayb you know if peopl could take a class and then they could get the book there someth in there mayb they can fix like two dish where they can fix that they might like that where it would help them you know build someth start work on get the weight becaus i was on the bus i think i was on the bus the other day and to compar myself to where some peopl was and i said to myself ain't no way in the world uh-uh i said no uh-uh ain't no way i can uh-uh and i thought about it i said i got to i said we'r go to do someth about this becaus you know heavi has come in both side of our famili you know and and i said well to myself i said well if i can work on myself this will work on her then it won't be as bad you know becaus i be tell her i said well you know i be feel tire you know i don't be want to do thing and and stuff and there so much go on with the health situat nowaday i was watch a program that say that it what you it what we take and what we eat that kill our bodi i didn't think about it at first
428	cg: it say what you eat and what you take kill the bodi and i said hmm so i thought about it i said i haven't been i haven't been to a health store mayb about onc mayb twice i haven't been back no more sinc but i think this year i'm go to make some of the chang and you know go to the health food store buy a littl stuff you know that mayb that could realli kind of make a chang when it and and see what the differ is becaus after you know i have i have ran across some thing seen a lot of stuff i said no so i was think that that would be a good mayb a good help mayb with peopl that couldn't afford it and then you know they can look at the littl handbook and say okay i think i can fix this you know whatev and i thought about it i said well if they got it for peopl that diabet regular peopl could be abl to eat it but the thing about it you just got to get a certain part that you like to fix and that would be a you know mayb like a begin so i was watch the commerci where they had this book out about peopl that you know diabet and how they can eat the stuff but you could eat it without have to have they have differ tast in the stuff but you know i be watch the cook show with the differ chef and stuff and they were say that there stuff out here where you don't have to use sodium and it tast just as better i said yeah that true but you got to look at the expens of it you know a lot of peopl can't afford it so and i was like hmm you know mayb if we can learn the differ type of stuff that where we can fix instead of eat all the sodium that probabl can be a littl bit better
429	cg: you know a littl bit better becaus i was think it a realist of it becaus there a lot of peopl out here do want to do it but look at the status of how to do it and financ you know becaus we know sodium salt season and you know all the cook oil and you know and stuff like that so i said well mayb if they can show the differ type of stuff which you can fix with the food where it could be reason how where they can eat it and then it won't be as bad tast with the sodium becaus which i alreadi know i got high blood pressur and i know you know it be like get inaud and it kind of bad when you got it tast you could take a pinch of sodium and you eat it and your blood pressur goe sky high you know so
430	cg: well you know what ? i'v been tri i'm i'll say like this i was do okay for a minut halfway but at the end i fell back you know it was just the willpow especi when you be around other peopl you know
431	cg: so it and all the cook food you know all the stuff and so a guy told me he said well if you barbecu fix it when you know you can fix it where it can be eaten right but you don't have to put all that you know heavi sauc and this and that you know there differ stuff where you can put on it i said i'v been do this for year you mean to tell me it ain't go to look right without no barbecu sauc without no dip you know but inaud you know it other stuff that they they have now you know but like with the organ food it good but i went i want to buy one of the the organ it a sauc but it was organ and i said oh i said i know it good but you know just just the the price of it i said okay i said well i just have to come in here one day and get it and just you know buy it and so this guy say well realli a lot of peopl can stay healthi if we just stay away from the stuff that that what hurt us but it hard becaus they keep them in the store so they got to figur out a way to get the money
432	cg: you know what you should eat but some store do some of them don't now i was think like well mayb they will have it like you know with appl and orang and stuff you know someth that will we know we'r go to pick up but someth that we know that will keep us go you know in case we get up and just you know right but i know i know about two or three store that do have fruit okay and it matter of fact it on the right over here by henri ford
433	cg: they do sell their fruit product they did have littl you know stuff in there but it just the distanc where you have to go you know and get that stuff but it would be nice if all store could do that becaus you know realli to be truth we are i was alway told you are what you eat you know
434	cg: you know we are what we eat you know so eat all that fantast sugar and this and that and we wonder whi we feel as i call it discombobul mm-hmm laugh you know i feel discombobul so
435	cg: yeah but i i i look at it this way if we learn to eat certain portion of it and say well this is it mm-hmm save this for anoth day and then you know we can work you know then we can work it and i know that just eat a littl portion of this you'd be like that all ? i'm still go to be hungri you know but if you fix it where you know you won't have to worri you know worri about it or just say well i fix this just for today so i kind of i kind of see myself the way if i eat a littl bit of this today i could be alright you know mayb eat someth like a snack later you know that probabl can help me make the food last we got peopl that eat a lot and you know you'r kind of like tri to inaud not to do this or do that so it is it is kind of hard you know
436	cg: i don't know that the thing becaus like i said food wise i'v done-i realli monitor that i even monitor their allow and won't allow them to spend more than two dollar at the store laugh you know
437	cg: i kind of i think what it is for a lot of peopl that if we can like for instanc i would say me like a lot of peopl that those that are heavi are more extrem heavi tri to you know make it make it comfort to where they can get comfort come around you know have it to where either nutrit set you know you show them how to do it becaus there a lot of peopl out there that want it but they feel bad about it they feel like well nobodi you know care about me this one da da da da da but when you sit and you have to go in a nurs home and i i know becaus i'v work in them and i i had a ladi she was beauti but it was just that you know we couldn't be abl to take care of her the way we want to so and i kind of look at it i said well that you know other peopl want to but if we get show how what to you know what a better way you can eat or let have a littl group thing and then i think it'd be better if we help them you know becaus a lot of peopl feel like they'r be funni they'r be talk about or whatev but if we help them with the situat with their weight it can help them as far as well you know they don't want to do anyth and that would make them neglect of their self their gene you know not want to go out and particip in differ thing so i think that it kind of would would you know
438	cg: well you know what ? i i i felt like that at time myself for a while i did i have felt like that at time myself becaus i i i kind of like in a way could put myself in somebodi els shoe you know i don't want to go out there ain't nobodi go to tell me how to eat and do this but if you got anoth person mayb feel the way do to be like look you know mayb it would be a help benefit becaus you know not so much with health problem but it could make a differ you see what i'm say ?
439	cg: accord how you eat and realli that it if you eat the way you'r suppos to you probabl would feel better you won't
440	cg: you know i know sometim you know when we work hard and you be tire and we eat the wrong food i'll be see in like a a commerci they said well we eat order all the stuff and we be at work and then you know and i tri one time somebodi told me they said "whi don't you order a veget a veggi pizza" ? i'm like "a veggi pizza ? what a veggi pizza go to do for me ? you know i want to eat a meat you know meat lover pizza" but they said "no tri the veggi pizza you know you might"
441	cg: "switch over" you know so i said well i'll tri it so what i did i took a slice of veggi pizza and i took a slice of the of the hamburg you know meat lover with the chees and all i said well it wasn't bad but i said no but i got to get myself use to it so and and i find that a lot of peopl that are vegetarian they they they skin is more clearer they live a littl longer and i notic the peopl that what do they call them peopl that have black hat and they have all black ? you don't know what i'm talk about ?
442	cg: and they you know they healthi you don't see them they'r not they'r sick you know they don't get sick or none of that and i'm think like hmm they don't get sick they don't go to the doctor as much you know but they have their own stuff where they you know do stuff and i use to hear my grandmama and them talk about how they use to make their own remedi you know they said we ain't go to no doctor you know those that could afford it but made remedi you know the kid was fine they go back to school and everyth and i said well what happen ? well everybodi got away from all that so you know yeah i i think that would be pretti good you know okay you know i think it would help it help me even though this will be the first time but i think mayb if i come like a littl bit more you know learn how to cut my i'm i'm like this
443	cg: you know becaus it would not onli help me it might could be like help the next person
444	cg: you know show him you know and like hey you know whi not ? becaus you know everybodi deserv want to live longer but i the way how we are you know it not go good
445	cg: yeah becaus i my thing of it is it just that if i can just get to where you know i know i don't like the littl slushi stuff you know whatev but just learn to cook the differ stuff that with we can eat you know without all that sodium eat differ stuff they have where they are season but not sodium season you know what i mean ? get use to it i think that that would be a good part you know well i it will help a lot of us
446	cg: becaus i know they'r go to go buy chip or a candi bar and i'm not even crazi about that caus i know onc if i let her have go get a twix onc a week that enough she'll be happi so i'm not even knock out all the junk food becaus i know give her a littl bit she'll be happi with that so diet i'm realli good with
447	cg: okay yeah i think that would for a mother well for a mother that you know with ani mother with daughter you know i think this would be a good help becaus it would show a lot of interest and concern not onli just on my behalf but her and that would you know let her be how she would need to be you know when she get older so okay you know but i think that where you know if my mom probabl would have stuck with me probabl would have put it in my head a littl bit more you know don't eat this you know we ate veget don't get me wrong we did eat veget and everyth but learn all the good stuff that you know they cook it it like you know don't eat too much of that it might make you this way you know and stuff so i kind of like i love my veget i think that about as far as i will get though becaus then i look on the other hand like yeah you know but i think it pretti good you know okay if we have like you know can do that you know with a parent or a brother or sister it someth that it need to be encourag becaus as i was read a survey and it said they said michigan and anoth state was more popul of high riski overweight and obes but it goe along with the health issu of you know how the famili what go on in the famili gene sometim but it doe help to eat right if you have a health condit mm-hmm so to me it more not onli is this help me you know it help her so
448	cg: i think she should you know you know i want her to make the choic that what she want becaus she want to set her goal and how you know where the best you know where where you know could set to be abl to help her i want to help her as much as i can but becaus like i said it i feel like when it a famili it can be a famili thing but most with a famili situat and especi if you can find one that real close togeth okay that can help a lot you know so now i wouldn't mind whatev she you know want set to do you know i just have to you know make adjust on my own stuff to make sure that that can be there becaus yes becaus that would help and i think for a lot of peopl you know that inaud say you know if they have to reduc you know if y'al had that they wouldn't want to use the video i think that it should be as a famili or a a close person somebodi that they care about and do it togeth becaus sometim when you do it by yourself it not it it can happen but it don't kick in as fast when you have two peopl that sit down and talk about it you know you know mayb we should go this rout or mayb that person will go that rout you know it like a you'r get a boost from one anoth mayb one don't want the boost but you get that boost from that person and make them go to that level where you know this is someth i need to do becaus mayb it'll make me be better in thing where i need to do and the other activ so yeah
449	cg: yeah it a benefit becaus a lot of time everybodi may not get the benefit mm-hmm but out of one person just one person could get the benefit out of it and you know and it would make them help them to go and do thing a littl better you know so a lot of peopl don't alway don't want to but if they get that encourag it tri it kind of like you know keep them go
450	cg: you know get them start you know get them start so
451	cg: yeah becaus you know you don't it like say even though you may think they feel bad alreadi feel bad on the insid but if they get them go to make their their outer appear make them feel good with themselv then that that can kind of like you know make it to the next step you know next stage or whatev i think that would help i think in anyth ani program ani research or anyth you know you want to to see how the outcom of if it not both mayb just the outcom of one person you see what i'm say ? mm-hmm and that can can help adjust mayb help somebodi els so
452	cg: yeah it it it realli well becaus like you know as i feel it not enough of group support person i want to say group but support you know and i think that well is that someth can that can elev them you know push them to do someth mm-hmm mayb if we can you know and i thought about it but i just didn't get push you know until she told me that you know my daughter my daughter had was on it i think she was on the internet or someth whatev and then she had call my number and she said is alicia around ? i'm like no she said that she got a babi sister i said yeah her sister you know is 11 but just she turn 12 today and you know we'r talk and i said yeah i probabl will go but now as i see you know that i understand that you know we have you have to chang the way of eat then this is where to chang and the way of lifestyl too becaus when you eat a way of lifestyl with everybodi els it doe show you know
453	cg: yeah she love basketbal
454	cg: yeah well i think you know she she pretti good i mean you know she like she know what she want she just got to onc i onc she get guid through you know and everyth and i think this is one of a plan that could be good you know we just have to work on it and everyth and i was tell her we are go to do these thing becaus you know it show an interest in that and it show an interest you know with me too right so it a thing that i just wish it was a way to be abl to show her you know with her dad and let him know like you know but it not if they inaud mayb this is someth we need to look at becaus you know lord know laugh you know but it just you know a start so
455	cg: i think mayb by start this where this will get a chanc to get everybodi you know to
456	cg: it may not get everybodi but at least it will be someth for us you know and everyth
457	cg: yeah and i i'm glad i'm realli glad that she you know she want to make the challeng she do want to make the challeng you know she tri veri hard you know and i tri my best to put you know my interest in it you know and everyth and you know support talk to her you know when i can and do so you know it a lot of thing that i want to do i know that as for some parent i know i should'v did this i know i should'v did that but i think it a time now that where you know when you have a child a certain age you know you got to look at thing a littl differ you know a littl more perspect and especi when they'r look on their own point of on their self just as well as inaud hey mom dad or sister or brother or what you know what this or that so it kind of like you need to you need to have that yeah yeah sometim but it may not alway be the support of famili but it could be of peopl that that be around them you know that can do it too so yeah i but i think basic the most import is from a person that want to have the willpow if you want it then that the person you need to be with say that one okay let do this you know becaus a lot of time you know it can it can get tire but when you have to look at it it make you it make you do you know you make chang you make a whole lot of chang definit
458	cg: well you know realli i'm i'm i'm kind of right now tri to take a you know a littl bit at a time you know i'm kind of glad now becaus then that way it more to me to help her while i'm help her help me a littl better so it could make some chang it a littl of both for me that where you know now as i get older i should have made chang but well you know but i could start you know start with one okay so you know just start with one
459	cg: yeah becaus i think that you know most of all we we just got to learn not to you know follow in the pattern of everybodi els oh i can't eat this and you ain't got to do that you ain't got to do that but sometim if we want to you know i hear i hear peopl say you know peopl be live to be 100 peopl be live to be you know 99 but you know you have a cutoff point somewher you do have a cutoff point
460	cg: mm-hmm yeah she will
461	cg: and i and i think this will be her way you know it could be like hmm she could put it up on her put it up on her refriger and be like okay now this is what i set this is what i want to aim at you know stuff like that

579	cg: his weight is too big for his size i have concern you know about the children teas him at school you know just talk about him and he come home when he upset and when peopl talk you know talk about him sometim ronni hold his feel in and it turn into anger where he don't want to be bother he has he don't realli have mani friend like his brother do it more becaus i guess becaus he you know big for his size and the kid see i mean i'm realli concern caus sometim you know i ask ronni whi you know sometim he'll just eat just becaus and yeah sometim he'll say that he depress or you know don't nobodi love him and you know sometim i'v had that experi you know as you know nowaday these children are more intens in what they say now than i was you know i would hear "fat this fat that" but now it more harsh where they'r cuss with it
580	cg: so i mean he take a lot in and then it like when he come home you know i tri to work around it becaus i want to do the same thing to help him get fit and you know we work out togeth and i'v even tri to go to a gym with him but they wouldn't accept him becaus he wasn't of age
581	cg: than what he is you know and sometim and i don't want to go into the gym a lot but sometim i have to go in there and i just say "ronni just write your name don't write your birthday just write your name" and we'll work out and he said he enjoy it when we go in togeth but it like with the financ we don't realli have you know that much to kind of get a membership togeth you know it like you know i'll pay for him or i pay for myself you know it not i want to get a membership to where we can go togeth as a famili and it afford where i can pay for us to go in
582	cg: we'r close
583	cg: i'm veri unhappi about it veri unhappi
584	cg: this is like my passion; i want to do this you know when i get down this side i want to help somebodi els but right now it like me and my famili just go through the process but it like certain thing that i want to you know like the you know the fruit and veget and you know i have that in my refriger ronni like them but it like i have to get to the point where you know he like the other stuff too and like a coupl week ago i cut out everybodi we'r off the pop
585	cg: yeah but it you know it like "mama whi can't we drink pop" ? becaus in our famili my grandfath my mother no my grandfath my two aunti and my mother and my cousin they all pass away from diabet overweight my cousin her leg was amput you know she was on dialysi there so mani health diseas in our famili to where you know like it like a generat thing you know so this is like you know for me i don't realli get that support from my other famili you know like you know but i know here this is what i realli realli want to do encourag each you know encourag peopl to maintain or get healthi but they don't listen becaus i'm not do it i mean i'm do it but i'm not do it right

587	cg: it is it is
588	cg: you know and so i guess you know at this point what can i be of help with ? you know if we were to think about what the first step is that you want to take today what can i help you think about do ? you know it like basic green made out of chip and they'r good but you know my problem is i let peopl you know kind of dampen my spirit and it like my kid watch me and they'll be like "wow someth wrong with mama" ? caus i just have this passion for want to get you know healthi and want nutrit and want for my famili especi ani family- it doesn't matter what color you are it just healthi you know becaus diseas do not discrimin
589	cg: like i said that one of the better thing is to incorpor him and make him a part of it that whi i say the famili thing but she doesn't like to do thing with him you know so tri to find a way that i can incorpor him in part and do thing that she can do on her own like if i can't do this with her this day will she do it on her own or can she do it on her own ?
590	cg: it doesn't discrimin
591	cg: yeah i don't know whatev ya'll can whatev you think is benefici for me and him becaus this like i said is you know statist say you know for peopl you know i watch a seri about where you know how i forgot his name he a man he tri to make a differ around the citi i mean around the countri of instead of process food the fresh food and there was a man on there he a funer home owner and he said nowaday that the casket are not small anymor they size of you know i mean this is someth i realli realli i don't have no problem but it like i said the financ and the abil you know it like with his cloth it like for a pair of pant for him is like fifti dollar

640	cg: a littl push yeah
641	cg: tri to look into tri to find a littl exercis plan or someth tri to sign up with the boot camp see if hope she can be abl to go with me to it as well i'm go to tri to look go on ahead and look on into that and stuff with the boot camp for the femal
642	cg: okay both time-but see i don't know what to tri then like if that just the part okay like if the health issu get in the way then what ? i don't know what to do from there like even with her own like i said she has arthriti she has asthma it veri rare bother her but she doe have asthma so like the health issu get in the way then what would be an altern ? just tri to find an activ that she can do that less intens ?
643	cg: when i found out that how much she weigh i was surpris and i think she carri it veri well it was veri overwhelm laugh and i think she need to lose weight so that how i feel
644	cg: : she been exercis a littl more she been walk and i'v kind of chang how we eat
645	cg: : laugh to be honest i thought it was more of like nutrit how to balanc meal what it is that you know you can or main thing that you need to stay away from and thing you probabl need to gravit toward
646	cg: right yeah so just got to find one she will to do
647	cg: : i guess on the healthi restaur and the portion size
648	cg: : of cours we'v cut back on eat out more
649	cg: : and so i mean even with me instead of cook we ate out a whole lot caus we all went through like i said we all went through a chang
650	cg: : so and then you know not be abl to be with her at school to know what she eat at school becaus i know go up to their school or go up to her school it a lot of other choic they can choos from without you know do a regular school lunch and there so mani thing like they have a thing call a 46:10 stick and it about this long and it just full of chees excel laugh so you know now they sell ice cream sandwich and snicker bar you know the snicker candi not the candi the ice cream bar and stuff like that at school so one of the thing that i'v been tell her is that not onli do you have to watch what you eat when you'r with me caus i can watch you when you at home i can watch what you eat but you have to also watch what you eat when you'r in school becaus i'm not with you so you have to be conscious of that : so then you know if you'r in school you know if you don't be honest i don't know what you eat
651	cg: : right so you know and i told her you know you can't alway go back for second you know caus sometim you eat just becaus it there and not so much just becaus you'r hungri becaus it was good and you like what it was but you know you also have to learn to control that so 47:38 veri interest in thing that i can you know go by
652	cg: so for this part i think i need to realli work with her like if this get in the way then what is she will to tri then ?
653	cg: : you know so i mean and like on the school lunch they one of the thing i know becaus you know sometim i go up there becaus i have anoth daughter that in school and have lunch with them and stuff like that but you know like you can buy a chef salad on the side it not part of the school lunch but most of the thing that they'r sell on the side you can buy half of this is full of french fri you know what i'm say ? for two dollar : pop machin you know you don't have to get the milk you get the pop you know stuff like that so that one like i said you know that the time where i'm not with you so it up to you in what you do caus we can go by the rule at home all day long but you go in school and buy three four five dollar worth of stuff and it not veri expens that the thing so if you do that and you eat it all at school it mean you know everyth els that you'r do is kind of null and void or it not balanc out so you have to also you know learn to control yourself
654	cg: : you know well yeah one of the thing it was ask in the survey that i saw was for her to write down what she did eat : and i think that was an excel idea
655	cg: : mm-mm i'll just need to read about it
656	cg: yeah i think we have to do it
657	cg: : she yeah she focus on do it
658	cg: : right she has 53:47 do her exercis togeth she has three sister and two still at home : so and they tri to they realli tri to motiv her and help her yes
659	cg: : to make sure that she stay on track and do the thing that she say on here you know i'll make sure she talk it out if she have a crave you know tell her she has to deal with it or you know you can't you know i buy a lot of yogurt and i could probabl buy more fruit so instead of go to junk food she can go to fruit and you know veget she now one of the thing she like to eat carrot and ranch dress i don't know about the ranch dress but the carrot is good for her but mayb not the ranch dress so you know just you know keep her focus : and improvis right and improvis you know wherev i can for junk food make sure you know it the fruit and thing like that that there
660	cg: : we could just talk about it
661	cg: : becaus if i provid the healthier food she don't have to you know go buy the junk food go to yeah just you know basic go to the store and buy junk food you know caus she old enough where can walk to the store with her you know by herself or with her friend and if i provid it you know she don't have to do that she don't have to make the choic you know if they go to the store you know she can if it alreadi provid she don't have to do it well she alreadi know what she need to do so if she doe go to the store you know versus you know buy a pop she can buy like a fruit water or someth like that or you know a bottl of water versus buy you know like i said buy a pop you know she can buy versus buy chip you know or if you do buy the chip you can buy the bake chip or you know someth like that the chip you know where there less salt you know caus i know you just can't cut back everyth cold turkey or just stop it period but you know if you know we'r talk about it and if i'm provid a you know extra thing for her or the healthier thing for her then you know i know subconsci she will start to develop her own self-consci to know "no i don't need that no i'm not go to get that"
662	cg: : noth laugh
663	cg: right right it has to i mean becaus biolog you know obes peopl run on both side of the famili run in my famili and ran in her dad famili high blood pressur one of the thing he pass of a 57:53 stroke : so he had a 57:55 high blood pressur even befor he knew he had high blood pressur he had a build-up on the brain so it thing that i know that you know it biolog that there that we have to i found out that i have to do for my children in order for them to live healthier live and when they have children be abl to pass it on to their children
664	cg: : it i mean someth that we'v alreadi done and that sit down and talk you know put your card on the tabl this is your weight at 14 year old this is where you should be even with your height you know becaus i know she tall for her age also but this is where you should be and then like i said provid the healthier thing versus the altern thing so instead of buy the chip and cooki you know you buy chees cracker mayb and you know buy the yogurt and fruit veget that you need i mean the raw caus i know raw veget are good so
665	cg: : yeah i mean we did that right : we sat down and we had the talk you know and like i said when i found out what her weight was we sat down and we had-so our first step or the first step would be to sit down and talk about it : and you know see where we have went wrong and what we need to do to chang it
666	cg: i don't like it laugh mm-mm he got like a chest issu thing go on and it uh it nasti to me it like it shouldn't look like our chest and they say it from his weight but it could be and they say they realli couldn't do noth they say just peer pressur but his i don't know it look nasti he like walk around the hous with no shirt on and i'm like "malik we don't want to see that" laugh like you gotta think about it me and may his sister i'm like "we don't want to see that no"
667	cg: : mmm i guess my social support would for one be my other daughter and my sister and my mom
668	cg: caus no like the doctor said it fatti tissu they were say they realli didn't want to go in there and like do no oper surgeri but i'm you know it like he be 15 in a coupl more month if that what they realli gotta do you know caus i wanna grow up you know how a guy like to play basketbal with their shirt off or go to the beach they don't wear no shirt i don't want them to look like what in the world ?
669	cg: she doesn't think she okay
