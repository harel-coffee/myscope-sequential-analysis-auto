7	c: caus you mention think about walk around
8	c: and you don't see yourself lose much weight if you'r drive more instead of do the walk around
9	c: so get smaller is someth that you'd like to do
10	c: so don't mean too small find that balanc
11	c: so you know yeah lose weight
12	c: so you have some idea about the food again and the activ stuff
13	c: so you'v actual heard some stuff about how much activ you'r suppos to do like how long it suppos to last
14	c: so this is someth that you know you'v actual heard stuff about like spend a half an hour
15	c: and you'r not you know just spend half an hour you'r go for three time like an hour and a half you went around
16	c: so it sound like you have a pretti steadi schedul do that
17	c: so it not that excit to be there so you might as well do some activ
18	c: so right now you'r do about three or four day a week of go to the track
19	c: so it been a pretti you know solid period of time that you'v been do it and you'r go with peopl in your famili when you go to the track

26	c: so you'r find way to be activ even when you'r not at home you know when you'r over at other peopl hous and thing
27	c: and if you if you had a way to like you said a scale at home or other place that you could kind of keep track of your weight you might like that a littl bit more becaus then you would know so you'd see result that you have
28	c: so you could ask your mom to get that for you if you want but you'r not realli sure if have a scale is you know go to be the way that you want to see if you'r lose weight or not
29	c: so you'r think that if it too close togeth it go to be too small but if you'r wait for long enough then you'll see differ then
30	c: so she would probabl say yes and now you'r say that be abl to kind of see weight loss would help you bump up to that realli veri veri veri import of keep you go on the track for that
31	c: but you'r not quit sure if you want to ask her or not about the scale
32	c: so you'r be real i mean you know you don't need one at home you have one over at your uncl to weigh yourself at and they don't mind you use that whenev you go over
33	c: you don't realli want not interest in write down what you weigh
34	c: there someth about it that stop you

36	c: so you'r interest in write down what you weigh
37	c: so you do know what you weigh right now
38	c: so you'r not realli you'r not realli sure what it is that you want to do
39	c: you know you want to lose weight you just don't know how you want to do it
40	c: so you'r talk about you know lose weight a healthi way in term of make chang to eat and activ not the stuff on tv that easi and littl quick plan but you do like the littl flavor water packet
41	c: not someth that you'r think about get
42	c: your mom all right
43	c: so you don't realli have ani idea it just easier if she kind of tell you what she what she think that you should do and you'r cool with that all right so you'r look for her idea
44	c: not everybodi can make chang like that and see result so you actual were a littl uncomfort with your weight and decid to start do some thing
45	c: okay so you'r find some stuff that you'r alreadi do in term of thing at school and rotc is serious busi there laugh you'r work and then also kind of ad in a littl of your own where you'r do some extra walk outsid of school and you'v seen some loss with that
46	c: and it sound like you know you are kind of on board with continu to work with toward lose weight
47	c: all right and you even mention some stuff about kind of understand like sugar in food and how to deal with that all right
48	c: okay you can tri some sugar free
49	c: so right now it not someth that you'r do but it someth you'r think about do
50	c: so you'v got some realli person reason you know in term of you know the cloth you gave me the real stuff and then also some health thing that you see in your famili yeah like you care about your dad a lot and you'r think about your futur and how you want to be healthi
51	c: the sugar free packag ?
52	c: okay so the two big thing you realli want to focus on are the fri and cut back on those and also the fast food and you realli are think mayb like less than three time a week mayb onc or twice a week would be a good way for you to cut back on some of the calori from that
53	c: all right so you have three solid veget that you enjoy eat and other one you'r realli not into
54	c: laugh you know you mention a few time that you would like to add in some more veget in there and that there are some that you do like but there are some that you don't you don't like
55	c: so you could eat more is as you know so it interest that you'v definit play that whole that you know that there are certain veget that you don't like and that you do like and just by a matter of eat more of the one you do like you'd be up your veget intak without have to forc yourself to eat thing you didn't like to eat laugh
56	c: fri food okay all right so the fri food all right
57	c: okay so now the second one you mention which is the eat the three meal =
58	c: okay all right so you have this idea of in term of you know the fri food and you know you'v been realli mention a lot of thing specif
59	c: all right so you realli have this idea that you want to eat less of the fri
60	c: okay so number one chang to eat bake and number two to talk to your mom about how she make the food
61	c: you'r realli focus on this idea of you know make the chang out with the fri
62	c: yeah the three small meal a day
63	c: so eat a littl bit less in the portion size
64	c: eat less all right so eat less of the food
65	c: so you'll just tri to get out of there so you'r kind of realli think about how you can help yourself to stay on track with your weight loss goal you know so your number one idea would be just to talk about it right away but you'r not sure what they'r go to do so you have a plan b as well
66	c: so it kind of i mean so to you it kind of make sens that by take that off you'd be get down on the calori but in term of actual go and do that that might not be the choic that you would make
67	c: your idea is realli to have just like the one full piec instead of have more of the piec
68	c: well what you know you'v alreadi realli kind of said that you were interest in talk to your mom and your dad about the fri food and everyth in the hous
69	c: all right so she could kind of cut back on certain thing that are around the hous and then it just wouldn't be the onli thing that peopl were eat
70	c: so that would work
71	c: okay so it kind of that simpl you want to lose weight and mayb you'r free to find out more about how to do it or where to get start
72	c: okay so kind of just mayb give her some inform about you know the import of weight manag and decreas fri food
73	c: all right and then you talk about want to talk to her about you know kind of ask her what she would think about decreas the fri food when we were togeth
74	c: so realli go back to that idea of health and that you said even bake good can tast as bake food can tast good and stuff
75	c: so it sort of like catch yourself when you'r hungri a littl hungri but not like all the way hungri
76	c: a three okay so you know you'r feel a littl confid about it
77	c: so you'r still feel a littl two way about you know go for cut down on the fri food
78	c: so they tast good but you'r realli think about your health and your weight and kind of those long term thing yeah
79	c: okay so eat the small eat a small meal at regular time you'r say versus wait until it too much all right
80	c: okay so you'v alreadi made a lot of chang it sound like that got you from in the 80s to the 70s and you feel pretti confid now about thing you'v also mention feel better
81	c: so it sound like you feel better sort of emot fell more confid feel like you can do it and you feel better physic mayb more energi get outsid more instead of lay around more so you'v alreadi notic a fair a lot of posit from lose
82	c: okay so you kind of came up with a veri specif chang in term of breakfast and befor you use to have pancak and sausag a lot of the time and now everi other day you do a smoothi and a whole grain carbohydr
83	c: you think you can do it okay like on a scale from one to ten where one is like i don't think i can do it at all number ten like i total think i can what number are you ?

613	c: you just want to do them okay so you don't need to write it down

615	c: okay you'r go to walk around the block talk to your dad about the truck to the treadmil
616	c: and play some basketbal
617	c: that it not healthi
618	c: you said that you need to eat right and do healthi activ is that what you said ?
619	c: okay well so let return to this to the to the topic of weight for a moment you said that one of the thing that you think that you need to do is to eat right and to do some healthi activ
620	c: so again you'r kind of get back to like well some part of the food is healthi and some part you'r not quit sure about like with the grapefruit ad the sugar and thing
621	c: okay so you'r pictur yourself join some pretti activ sport
622	c: well so you mention a coupl minut ago that you have anoth idea and that is that mayb you need to eat healthier
623	c: okay so when you think about eat healthier you think about eat thing like salad that are healthier food but you also think on the other side of get rid of some unhealthi food so you see that there are two part to chang eat
624	c: okay so in your mind if if your weight chang then you'd be abl to do more thing that you could enjoy and you would also be abl to help some other peopl
625	c: sure yep so a minut ago you said if you lost weight then you'd be abl to do other thing that you enjoy and you'd be abl to help other peopl
626	c: okay so so if you lost weight then what you'r say is that you'd be abl to to be more skill in some of the area you want to be skill in like you could run faster which mean that you'd be abl to enjoy play basketbal more
627	c: and you said you'd do some of the other thing that you'd like to do
628	c: mm-hmm well some of those thing you it sound like you might need some help with becaus you'r a kid and you'r not the one that make some of the choic sometim you might need some help from somebodi
629	c: mm-hmm so you'd like to hear from them some encourag word some support say inaud you can do this
630	c: you'v you'v pick a coupl of thing that you feel like you could do right now
631	c: and so one of the best way to know what in the food that what you'r drink is what you'r alreadi do with the fruit snack which is
632	c: you'd like to realli meet some strong goal becaus you have somebodi in your famili who was a basketbal player and it your favorit sport you would like to play too
633	c: walk okay
634	c: read the label yeah
635	c: so you can get use to it and keep do it
636	c: yeah you want to play
637	c: basketbal so that might be a first step okay so so if your plan is to start walk and you want to do that becaus you could get use to it yes
638	c: so let see how about as far as like a good start point ? do you think that that where you could start out or would you have to start out a littl bit slower than that ? mean a littl bit less than that
639	c: okay so you see i see that you'r think kind of in the long term like i see that there are some chang that i need to make today but you also see the benefit of do it for a long time
640	c: which is a pretti pretti good thing to do i mean you don't have to do it everi singl day but i like your i like your idea
641	c: oh ! the big goal so you can play basketbal
642	c: so it not the same as gatorad it not the same as kool-aid
643	c: okay one solut that you just mention is that you'll just have to get use to it becaus she has some need and part of what you may have to do is understand those
644	c: in term of you know think about what you'r drink and keep in mind that sometim peopl drink a lot of calori that they don't know about
645	c: and it might be more a matter of just find way to bring them togeth so there anoth piec i'v heard a littl bit about yet but we haven't talk a lot about and you said you sometim go and you kind of run around and you do lot of activ so that the other piec is how much physic activ doe it take
646	c: yeah someth that you
647	c: so the overal messag that i'm hear from you is that your motiv realli come from within
648	c: okay so walk swim bike sound like exercis that you feel confid that you can do and you want to do them
649	c: so your import goal realli are health relat like you find that in the futur you know that there are some risk associ with be bigger and that you would like to avoid those and so you'r take action now to do that
650	c: so realli go back to that activ activ piec
651	c: okay so it sound like you'r pretti set on use a food log might be the most benefici first step you could take some peopl when they identifi what would be a great first step for them they come up with a plan ?
652	c: well so you mention someth that is import to you is have the food log hang up where you can track of it use it as a tool
653	c: so you'r kind of hear it from other peopl
654	c: oh i got you so if it ring while you were fill out your food log one thing you mention you could do is either shut it off ahead of time so it doesn't disturb you
655	c: so you'r feel like if your mom was to support you by do it like her own food log ?
656	c: okay so you want to do both you would like her to have an opportun to see it so that she can develop her own plan too base on that and then you also want to talk about it when you come togeth
657	c: yeah yeah you'v got a whole written plan now you
658	c: so find other peopl to kind of hang out with and do thing like walk around the neighborhood but it not alway veri much fun
659	c: but at the same time i hear a littl bit in your voic as you'r talk too that you don't it sound like you'r not realli sure you need lose weight or how much mayb
660	c: and you'v done quit a bit of research on the internet tri to find someth that realli grab your interest in term of activ
661	c: okay so it sound like some hurt thing have been said and that kinda make you feel like okay mayb mayb i do need to make some chang but at the same time you don't feel like you need to compar to some other peopl your age you'r smaller sizewis ?
662	c: but you mention someth earlier and that is that for your health mayb some thing need to chang
663	c: so it kind of go back to this idea that the eat part of thing is someth that you'r realli work on and make some realli activ chang with like your portion size
664	c: so what i hear from you is that for peopl who want to be a smaller size they do a few thing they spend more time be activ and you mention about three time a week activ they make some chang to their eat which includ more healthi food smaller portion eat smaller amount of food and less often so for snack so eat less frequent those are exact the kind of thing that peopl will get recommend from their doctor to do
665	c: but the activ part you know is where you'r kind of like "hmm i'm not quit sure what to do with it now"
666	c: you mention that you felt like there were some area that you could make some chang that you'r not do right now
667	c: okay that pretti high up there seven
668	c: so you'v been ask for help with your food the kind of food that you eat and the way they'r prepar you'v also been ask for permiss to go and do more activ it sound like okay
669	c: so chang in eat are import to you you have three area that you'r look at one is cut out the late night snack one is eat a littl bit less and anoth one is ad in some more fruit
670	c: so what i hear a littl bit too is this idea that you have to let yourself be full instead of eat more food you didn't say this but mayb eat faster make peopl not realiz that they'r full right away so those are some idea
671	c: okay so let see so your plan is to not get so much food on one plate
672	c: so learn how to slow down and stop befor you'r overful sound like an import thing for you
673	c: yeah and that what we'r talk about right now in help you to think about the thing that would stop you from get a smaller portion of food
674	c: so if you see someth that you realli like what it sound like you'r tell me is that if you see someth you like that instead you could
675	c: and i hear you say is there are some food that you think might be healthi choic but you'r not posit and you wanna check in and make sure
676	c: okay alright so you mention the first thing that you can do when you leav here today to reach your goal is to get a healthi snack
677	c: yep you could say that it also sound like a bigger point that you'r make is that choos a healthi snack instead of an unhealthi snack seem like the big messag that you'r get at there paus
678	c: so you'r think of way that she could realli be support to you paus inaud
679	c: so it kind of interfer sometim with play with your friend
680	c: mm-hmm so you'v ask your princip if you can go to the gym dure lunchtim at school ?
681	c: okay so you feel like you'r get peopl are say thing you don't like veri much in a number of area not just in school well so tell-
682	c: okay so you made two chang
683	c: okay so a coupl month ago  ?
684	c: so for the most part you'r pretti comfort with your weight
685	c: okay so peopl have notic what you'v been do and they'v stop talk in way that you don't like that must feel pretti good
686	c: the sugari drink ? okay
687	c: okay so you'v made a person choic to turn it down when somebodi offer you if you want some ?
688	c: okay so that a third chang that you'v made is you'v decid to respond to peopl differ
689	c: well these are some pretti big chang that you'v made recent do you feel confid that you can keep up with those chang ?
690	c: okay okay so what you'r tell me is that you feel confid at the level of a ten becaus when you look around you ?
691	c: but are you think mayb get out and practic a littl bit more would be help or ?
692	c: mm-hmm and that an idea that can help with weight loss too becaus the more activ you are the more that can help you in two area right ? one with your health and one with how skill you are at catch the ball ok
693	c: by the school that you go to ? okay ?
694	c: and i guess when you say it okay i don't know if you mean like it okay i don't want to hear about it or it okay i do want to hear about it
695	c: okay so you have a place to go you have an idea of what to do
696	c: oh okay so you have somebodi that could help you ? alrighti so i'm go to make sure that you get this sheet so you can refer back to it later and make sure that you rememb some of the idea that we talk about okay ?
697	c: i know that you have a coupl differ reason whi you would like to practic footbal
698	c: okay so practic two hour per day is so that you can run better is the main thing that you want to work on right now on top of the nice chang that you'v alreadi made
699	c: some peopl even invit their friend to do the extra practic with them
700	c: so now you have two solut then you might even say invit your friend to do extra practic with you
701	c: okay so eat more fruit and some veget ?
702	c: 33:14  ?
703	c: so okay so one thing you have tri to do is you'v tri to be a littl bit more activ and it seem you have some activ that you do alreadi but you tri to add on to that at the end
704	c: okay so you'r talk a littl bit on the idea that there is a serv size on label that say how much of a certain thing you should have and that sometim if it look like it probabl a healthier item you might have a littl more
705	c: the groceri list
706	c: yeah so you'r think of look at food that are avail at the store to see if mayb there are some healthier choic that aren't quit as expens
707	c: oh i see okay so well you know what about book at the librari or at your school librari even do you think that there might be ani that have inform about calori in differ kind of food ?
708	c: yep that one idea is to go get a physic
709	c: becaus you'r kind of interest in how to get into a healthier place or where you should be
710	c: so you realli see that if you had some kind of list that you could refer back to and you saw a chang that you either like or didn't like you'd be abl to look back and say "okay i see what help me or i see what got in my way now i can make that particular change"
711	c: yep so mayb that sheet that i show you befor might be help this one that has differ choic you might be abl to use that to estim when you don't know exact or if you were abl to get some book from the librari that might help you too yep so sometim that is exact what we do we do the best of our to what abil we have
712	c: okay so rememb is the onli thing you can see that might get in your way
713	c: okay so your plan is to chang your eat habit
714	c: do you feel like if you and your mom for exampl were abl to come up with some idea on healthier food that mayb are not quit as expens but better than some of the thing that you have right now
715	c: i mean mayb mayb not the healthiest most expens food but i bet there are some healthi choic that are not quit as pricey you know so that might involv some thing like do a littl research or work togeth to come up with some compromis
716	c: yeah laugh that a pretti strong motiv for you isn't it
717	c: yeah it sound like this realli is someth import that you feel like you can make some signific chang that will be help to you
718	c: okay so you see this as kind of a teamwork like if you work on it togeth you'r both more like to be success yeah
719	c: oh so you feel like it won't be more effect or she might hear it more if it come from someon els okay
720	c: okay so you'r look for some idea on what to do ?
721	c: mm-hmm okay so you do sit-up
722	c: oh okay kind of like flutter kick or that kind of thing okay alright so you have a littl bit of a workout that you do with your sister
723	c: and you'r interest in how to get as where you should fall
724	c: okay so you'v got a coupl thing that you do that might be differ from what other peopl do

726	c: you'v alreadi mention physic activ so peopl becom more activ and it sound like that someth that alreadi in place for you
727	c: okay so you'r cut down on portion
728	c: your portion okay
729	c: okay ? and then the other option i was go to show you is this is a physic activ log where you could just keep track of what you do and that way you'd know whether it need to increas or decreas over time
730	c: okay so if you have a sens of how mani calori you burn then you could write that down too which might help you keep track
731	c: so if you were to circl for yourself 30 minut for each tv you could start to get a sens of whether this need to decreas whether this time spent be activ need to increas
732	c: so it seem like this is pretti import to you
733	c: yeah okay so it import to you becaus you would like to get your weight under control for yourself it sound like
734	c: like an idea
735	c: and you know i saw when you were talk about that you were kind of smile

739	c: okay so two thing that you mention is that one your sister might be abl to help you by say "you don't realli need to do that" and you might be abl to say that to yourself too so those are thing that could help you
740	c: okay so now we have anoth key word and that a distract
741	c: so if mayb we can think about it like this like if you mention that a crave could get in your way so we might say if a crave get in the way then i could tri someth that would be distract you might have to i don't know what would be distract for you but so you might have to think of some idea
742	c: and you might think of some other thing or you might notic some other thing as you'r use your plan and then i mean it your plan you can write them down anoth time too so
743	c: okay so if the first step that you could take would be to start put your money in your old pencil sharpen
744	c: okay so mayb that the first step for you to take is to put it up on the top of your closet and start use it okay
745	c: so there are time in your day that you'r be activ whether it run around with your friend and the fact that you have to get yourself to summer school
746	c: but it also that you kind of mention that you'r sometim be activ so there might be a littl bit of room for you to be more activ if you want to

749	c: earlier you mention that you'v start to do someth like you work out
750	c: you'r not sure what you want to talk about
751	c: so you see that as probabl a sourc where you know if you made some chang it could be help to you
752	c: and you can kind of compar like how mani calori

785	c: so a coupl thing that you'r talk about are that you feel like you'r too young to weigh what you weight and that there are some health reason whi you want to weigh less it not just like you have this idea but you have some realli ?
786	c: laugh so look like you have sever differ idea
787	c: so let see so one thing that you mention is that you tri to get back into your order exercis okay and that you told wait whoever interrupt you to wait and that you'd ask befor you start so that a lot of plan ahead you know for stuff that you can do befor you start in the first place and if somebodi interrupt you you know two plan for what to do ?

791	c: so when you'r at home with all your friend it you know pretti heavi duti you can do more of the sport and thing that you can't do at your grandma
792	c: and you'v got some idea on you know thing that you feel like there are some chang that you want to make and that you'v actual it sound like you'v made a few i mean you'r eat differ
793	c: so your cloth are fit you differ and you'r see that you'r abl to you know play sport a littl bit better jump higher and do thing differ with the weight loss well you know we'r talk a lot about activ today and a lot of realli posit thing that you'r do
794	c: okay so it sound like you'r kind of readi like i don't need to convinc you laugh

797	c: like you said that you were think about mayb less tv
798	c: okay so it actual i mean from what you'r say it actual sound like if we you know were to come up with a plan for cut out some tv time that realli that wouldn't make a huge differ caus if i'm understand you correct
799	c: you don't watch much of it
800	c: so sometim when you'r just come home and and you'r hungri and so you don't necessarili pay as much attent to like portion or thing you just want to eat what you want to eat
801	c: so you'r at the you'r at i guess what i'm hear you say is you'r at the point where onc you know what you'r go to do noth go to stop you
802	c: so kind of go in there eat someth get back outsid

809	c: cool get your speed back
810	c: so you kind of have a goal in mind of get readi for footbal /text>
811	c: so you'r do some practic and footbal is someth that realli import to you you want to keep play it you like it
812	c: so four year now
813	c: it someth that realli fun for you and you'v notic that your weight has kind of gotten in the way on how well you can perform
814	c: so you'r have the snack and then you eat the dinner and that someth that differ than what you use to do befor
815	c: you lost some weight
816	c: so the activ piec realli help you to lose weight
817	c: so alreadi i mean you'r you'r fast but you want to take it to the next level and you'r realli notic that becaus it so import to get there and you know bring your weight down is go to realli help you push that level
818	c: alright so the activ stuff is realli fun and you'r go outsid and even in the wintertim you'r go to be abl to to get all that time outsid ?
819	c: it almost sound like figur out a way for you to stay activ when the weather get realli cold might be a way for you to keep on track paus
820	c: but you'r not realli sure
821	c: so if we had resourc that you could come here dure the wintertim and kind of keep up with your workout
822	c: and you know i wonder if talk to your mom about find place to be activ you know do exercis dure the wintertim might be a way to get more idea and stay activ
823	c: so it seem realli that you'd like to -no that okay you'd like to stay work on this goal on your own and not necessarili bless you and not necessarili talk to other peopl about it or you'r think that that mayb you talk to some peopl in your famili about it
824	c: so you'r realli not sure what you want to do when you leav alright
825	c: so it buy you a littl more time while she tri to catch up and it also that you'r run around more with that
826	c: so you'r not realli sure how much i would tell her but i can you know i could just tell her
827	c: so again when you'r at home with your friend you realli are move around to a lot of place when you get out and be with them becaus you'r alway travel around and go from one place to anoth and you know walk and run when you'r do all that
828	c: oh okay so you'r tri to cut down on sugar and kind of keep an eye on what food you put in your bodi
829	c: you said that you'v been tri to lose weight
830	c: okay so one of your concern is that you don't want to find yourself in a posit where you can't fit the cloth that you know
831	c: okay so you see that be overweight might be someth that could limit a person in what they can do and how they can move around or cloth they can wear yeah and i know it import to be in a posit where you can do those thing you know be activ and wear cloth that you like and that kind of thing okay
832	c: okay so a littl bit over a year you'v been work on it
833	c: oh okay alright and that a good way to judg you know whether or not you'v been success is that your cloth will fit differ
834	c: so she give you a lot a lot of chore to do around that keep you keep you move
835	c: okay and so one thing that you'v tri alreadi is chang the way you eat
836	c: but you'r also mention that chang your activ level may be help too okay
837	c: okay oh alright so you can realli pictur yourself do some thing like get on the treadmil and use some of the other machin
838	c: and box
839	c: uh-huh all right so that go to kind of keep it go for a while
840	c: yeah so you can pictur yourself build up to someth later on down the road
841	c: and you see that mayb that someth to work up to start small and build up to that gradual okay
842	c: okay so you realli see this as an import thing with help you with your health and overal i can sens i mean that that an import goal is to have better health
843	c: like a seven and a half
844	c: so you want to tri to find healthier drink
845	c: okay okay so you know you alreadi have some experi do that
846	c: mm-hmm and you probabl wouldn't have known that necessarili if you hadn't it written down
847	c: so safeti a pretti big issu so you'r realli think about the fact that you'r kind of stuck when you'r over there and you'r not =
848	c: so befor you said that you wrote down just the time and what the food was
849	c: oh okay so you saw that have a smaller portion gave you smaller calori
850	c: yeah yeah so appl have less calori than cooki and it sound like they realli fill you up too so that a realli handi thing to know huh ? laugh
851	c: okay so it almost look like you'd have to pick a time dure the day you know would work better for you
852	c: so safeti realli and not realli have stuff to do when you'r over at your grandma is one of the reason that you know you'r not necessarili a higher number on that import thing
853	c: okay alright so the veri first thing is to get a journal
854	c: okay so even though your mom brought you it was still someth you want
855	c: so safeti is also an issu kind of in your neighborhood it kind of cramp your style a bit becaus you'd like to be out later and run around and thing so it kind of the same not quit as bad as your gram
856	c: so let see can i look at what you wrote down ?
857	c: both okay so you realli see that it go to take a lot of peopl to help you out and i think you'r right
858	c: so this log right here you can take home with you also and this might be enough to get you start at least for a coupl of meal caus you have thing down on each of the line so until you get a journal this will give you a good start anyway
859	c: so you'r pretti happi with the amount of activ that you'r do over there even though it about 60% of what you'r do when you'r home you'r still pretti good with it
860	c: but you don't know
861	c: no ? okay
862	c: okay so you kind of have a sens that mayb there are some thing you could do differ as far as eat goe okay
863	c: okay alright so you'r kind of at a point it sound like where you think well you know mayb i could be a littl bit healthier and that might involv lose weight and it might involv chang some thing about the way i eat but it might not ?
864	c: yeah it differ like you you didn't guess that caus you thought that you were overweight but not obes and this is pretti high up there on the obes rang huh ?
865	c: i wouldn't have guess that becaus when you first start talk i was think that probabl you would have pick a lower number
866	c: oh okay so you have some limit that that you think are relat to weight okay
867	c: you know our focus is on weight so mayb we could talk a littl bit about how that fit for you and where you might go from here
868	c: okay so exercis more when you say healthier choic you mention earlier
869	c: okay alright and you'v been activ befor so mayb that would be someth you might enjoy get back into ?
870	c: that one ? okay ?
871	c: okay so you see yourself as do it more often but for less time ?
872	c: what you'r do right now is is pretti much all that you could do there noth els left
873	c: so it a matter of for you stick with what you'r alreadi do to kind of keep up with your weight loss that you'r see and the cloth be looser and the fact that you'r jump higher and thing
874	c: okay so despit have a realli full schedul you still feel pretti i mean seven is pretti high so you still feel pretti confid that you'r go to be abl to work it in there somewher huh ? okay ?
875	c: you might end up do it or you might not
876	c: all right so you'r say that you want to make your activ more activ
877	c: okay to kind of figur out what what you can do around that would be fun and then at your grandma hous do more stuff
878	c: all right so actual realli think about like realli specif thing that you could do when you'r there all right so you'r realli go for the weight loss idea
879	c: okay so kind of test it out
880	c: so she set a pretti good exampl with activ she pretti activ person
881	c: right caus it not realli as it a littl bit too much for you actual the amount of activ she do so actual hang with her walk with her isn't someth that you want to do
882	c: so she might not be the right person for help at your grandma to be more activ
883	c: so your grandma a pretti activ ladi too and sometim you'r as you know walk with her
884	c: so your gram go faster than what even on the tape and you don't alway like to do it with her becaus she a littl she doe it overdo it and you just want to stick with what the ladi on the tape do
885	c: well what you'r not sure realli then what to substitut becaus if you can't drink sport drink or cola or fast food beverag and now you'r even hear that even fruit juic if you drink a lot of it it still has calori
