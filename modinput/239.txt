301	c: yeah so i'm going to be talking with you for the next few minutes about weight loss and before we get started i just wanted to let you know that this is the part of our session where they turn the cameras on
306	c: do you have any questions about ?
117	t: no
305	c: no okay and also the work that we do today is pretty much focused on you one thing i wanted to call your attention to is that our work together is kind of like a team process so it might be different from doctor's appointments that you may have had in the past where maybe they just tell you what to do i'm not actually here to tell you what to do but i'm here to help you figure out what you want to do laughs okay
306	c: how does that ?
117	t: good
323	c: good good i saw you smile when i said that so
301	c: and just to let you know how things will proceed we'll meet for about 20 minutes and then i'll meet with your mom for 20 minutes and then the three of us will meet together for about 15 20 minutes ?
305	c: and just kind of getting back to what i said a moment ago about me not bossing you around or telling you what to do is that we kind of found that that just isn helpful for people because generally if you tell somebody what to do they might leave and never do it but if it's their own idea then that's better 'cause you are the expert in your life you're going to know how things fit for you and what you would be able to do and not do okay
306	c: can i answer any questions for you before we get ?
117	t: no
327	c: no okay laughs
305	c: so would it be an okay idea if we just started with talking for a minute about your weight and what you think about ?
117	t: yeah
343	c: okay so what do you ?
120	t: like can you give me an example of what you ?
343	c: sure yeah what do you think about your ?
112	t: i think i can do better by it and try to lose more weight
333	c: okay have you been trying to lose ?
117	t: yes
333	c: what have you been ?
106	t: trying to eat less like sugar and trying to watch what i eat at times and what time it is and stuff
313	c: oh okay so you're trying to cut down on sugar and kind of keep an eye on what foods you put in your body
333	c: and you said a little bit about time ?
103	t: yeah i don really eat sugar it's just like sometimes i eat sugar like when i really want some sugar
333	c: okay alright so you're trying not to do that ?
117	t: yeah
333	c: what other changes have you ?
117	t: that's about it
305	c: okay so you know if i can talk to you for a second just
313	c: you said that you've been trying to lose weight
331	c: and could you tell me why you've been trying ?
112	t: because i don want to be overweight to the point i can fit into any clothes or anything and that's about it
311	c: okay so one of your concerns is that you don want to find yourself in a position where you can fit the clothes that you know
112	t: you can do nothing like walk or anything
310	c: okay so you see that being overweight might be something that could limit a person in what they can do and how they can move around or clothes they can wear yeah and i know it's important to be in a position where you can do those things you know be active and wear clothes that you like and that kind of thing okay
333	c: how long have you been trying to lose ?
112	t: ever since i got diagnosed with lupus
333	c: okay and how long ago was that
305	c: if you don mind me ?
119	t: i think it was on october in '09
333	c: this past ?
119	t: yeah oh not this year in 2010 2009
313	c: okay so a little bit over a year you've been working on it
331	c: how successful do you think that you've ?
117	t: it's been okay
331	c: ? do you feel like you have lost weight ?
109	t: i feel like i have but on the scale i go on the scale and it shows the same thing or higher
332	c: oh right okay alright and so how do you explain that i mean what do you think is happening where you feel like you lost weight but the scale says you ?
120	t: what do you ?
332	c: what do you think happens that makes it so that you feel like you lost weight like what information do you have that tells you you lost weight when the scale says you ?
119	t: like the way my pants feel on me like if they're tight or not tight
311	c: oh okay alright and that's a good way to judge you know whether or not you've been successful is that your clothes will fit differently
117	t: yeah
307	c: so that must be confusing for you to get on the scale and find out that it's no change ?
303	c: has your doctor given you information about ?
120	t: ?
330	c: about 5:01 yep
112	t: yeah he told me that i had to limit what i eat and stuff 5:09
328	c: okay okay so i mean i guess at this point you and i have talked about a number of things and what i've learned from you is that you do want to lose some weight and it sounds like you're telling me it's partly for health reasons but also partly because you want to fit into clothes and make sure you still fit into them and that you have some other reasons related to being able to be physically active and walk around and do other things but that so far you've made some changes in what you eat but that you haven really seen a difference on the scale even though your pants fit differently
117	t: mm-hmm
305	c: okay well so what do you want to do about ?
112	t: try to exercise and do more activities
313	c: okay and so one thing that you've tried already is change the way you eat
311	c: but you're also mentioning that changing your activity level may be helpful too okay
333	c: do you have any ideas about what you might do ?
112	t: i'd go to the gym
333	c: okay and what would you do at the ?
112	t: probably get on the treadmill and the thing where you do like that and you go lift the bars up 6:28
333	c: is it like a weight thing where you like you pull the bar down
112	t: i think it's called weightlifting it's 6:33
313	c: okay oh alright so you can really picture yourself doing some things like getting on the treadmill and using some of the other machines
106	t: and boxing and boxing
313	c: and boxing
330	c: wow that will take some energy ?
333	c: have you done that ?
112	t: no that's what i want to do though boxing
330	c: okay laughs that sounds like an interesting activity certainly something that could keep you busy laughs
332	c: so when is you know what is at this point what's stopping you from doing those ?
109	t: my weight issues and my health problems
312	c: okay so you see yourself being able to do some stuff at the gym but right now you feel like you can
306	c: is that ?
117	t: yeah
328	c: and it's because you feel like you have to weigh less to start some of these activities and you have some other health issues like you mentioned being diagnosed with lupus and is that something that prevents you
109	t: yeah and i have high blood pressure so
307	c: okay okay well that must feel like you know a puzzle like what do you do ?
305	c: okay well so you know if you had to think about where you might start what do you think the first thing you might be able to do ?
120	t: what do you mean by ?
345	c: say that ?
120	t: what do you mean by ?
305	c: if you wanted to think about you know if you want to get to a point where you can do something like boxing what do you think you know the first step you could take would ?
106	t: maybe start by taking it slow like walking and exercising start off easy and then build your way up
313	c: yeah so you can picture yourself building up to something later on down the road
308	c: that's a really great way of looking at it too is
302	c: i think you know one of the things i've learned anyways is that people sometimes feel that they have a big challenge and that they want to be at the level of doing the boxing right away
313	c: and you see that maybe that's something to work up to start small and build up to that gradually okay
331	c: so you know i guess at this point a question i have to ask you is how confident do you feel that you can do those things that you can get ?
112	t: i feel comfortable
331	c: you feel comfortable with ?
331	c: so how important is it to ?
112	t: it's important
331	c: yeah so if i asked you like on a scale of one to ten with one being not at all important and ten being the most important thing in your life right this moment where would you put
112	t: probably about an eight or a seven
309	c: okay so that's pretty high up there isn ?
331	c: yeah so why would you say a seven or eight and not like a five or a ?
112	t: 'cause it's more important that you're healthy than overweight and you have more health problems than you already do
311	c: okay so you really see this as an important thing with helping you with your health and overall i can sense i mean that that's an important goal is to have better health
302	c: okay alright so well you know some people find that it's really helpful to come up with a plan for what they would like to do and you've started to talk about a plan already like "i have to do a couple steps first before i can do boxing" or maybe it's nutrition that you're interested in changing
306	c: but if we were to talk about a plan would that be interesting to you ?
117	t: yeah
305	c: okay so what would you rather focus on ? would you rather look at changing some eating habits or would you rather focus on changing physical ?
112	t: probably eating habits
305	c: okay alright so if you think for a moment about things you've already tried and things you might like to try what comes to mind for ?
120	t: can you give me like an ?
302	c: mm-hmm yeah so some people set a goal for themselves where they say "you know i've already tried cutting down on sugar" and they don really have that much now "so i think that i'm going to try eating fewer calories per meal or smaller portions" other people might say "you know i feel like i could have more fruits and vegetables in my diet and so maybe that's what i should focus on first"
305	c: but do you have any ideas like ?
112	t: yeah eat more healthier and try not to like if your friend tells you to go and eat some sugar try not to do it force yourself not to eat the sugar
305	c: okay and has that been pretty successful for you so far or do you feel like that's something you need to work ?
120	t: ? to have 11:32
330	c: to cut down on ? you feel like
106	t: like my brain tells me to eat a lot of stuff then my mind tells me "don eat it" so
331	c: okay is that working pretty well for you right ?
112	t: sometimes
302	c: ? is that the reason that i'm asking is i'm wondering if that's something you would like to focus on improving or if you feel like you're already doing well enough in that area and maybe there's something different related to eating that you'd like to focus on
112	t: i'd like to improve on it
302	c: okay great so i'm trying to think if i have some things in here that we might look at if that's okay it might give you some ideas let's see here so you're talking a lot about sugar in particular i guess if you wanted to make some changes in that area here are some ideas that might be helpful to you so some people decide we'll start with this one some people decide that one thing to cut down on is sugar in your drinks okay so they might just choose to make a change like maybe not drinking pop or fruit juice as much for example and so you can see here although this isn just sugar calories are an important part of what will help you with weight loss fewer calories means less weight okay another idea and this one's a little bit different too this isn necessarily sugar but it's calories
334	c: do you eat out very ?
112	t: not really
302	c: okay so this one might not be as helpful to you but this idea is basically if you were to eat out or eat these kinds of foods at home here are healthy choices versus unhealthy choices you get the choice between the two
305	c: so i'm going to put that one to the side for right now or leave it on the table for you to choose from but you said it might not be the most helpful to you
302	c: here's another one and this might be relevant for sugar-eating related this helps with portion sizes meaning how much of a serving you have at one time and so if for example you did have a sugary food or your mind told you you wanted one food but you tried to say "you know i think i'm just going to toss it off or have something else" this might be a way to you to get at that is thinking about how much food you have at each serving and that way it might not be the case that you always have to say "you know no i'm not going to have anything right now" you might just choose to have a different size and the last thing that we might think about working on today in a plan for you is just keeping track of what you eat so that you can see better where you could make some helpful changes so some people find it really helpful to write down like the day and time that they eat even if it's just a snack and what they eat and there's some other categories here that might be helpful but probably the next most important one is how many calories the food has
119	t: i had did that before i wrote it in a journal but i just wrote like what i ate and what time and stuff
311	c: okay okay so you know you already have some experience doing that
306	c: and did you feel comfortable with ?
117	t: yeah
119	t: i kept track of what i ate and all that stuff
331	c: how do you think that helped ?
112	t: it helped me a lot because sometimes i had overate and the portion sizes
311	c: mm-hmm and you probably wouldn have known that necessarily if you hadn it written down
306	c: is that what you're ?
305	c: okay so is that something that you would like to try again or would you like to try
106	t: yeah try again
302	c: okay okay well let me put these away for now and you're going to get these to take home with you because it may be the case that once you get good at doing this you might decide you want to do one of these other things too
313	c: so before you said that you wrote down just the time and what the food was
333	c: do you feel like it would be helpful for you to do that or how helpful do you think it might be to add some additional information like ?
112	t: it'd be helpful
331	c: do you know how to count ?
117	t: no
301	c: no laughs okay so i unfortunately don have enough time to show you everything that you would need to know today though
331	c: do you have somebody who might be able to help you count ?
117	t: yes
331	c: who could help you with ?
112	t: my mom or my grandma or my aunt
308	c: okay so you have three different people in your life who could show you how to count calories
305	c: which is excellent that's more than a lot of people have so so i guess if you and i think about what you would like to work on particularly you could think about you want to work on logging your food but a piece of that seems like it's learning how to count calories too it's almost like you have two goals in one ?
112	t: yeah like when i'm with my auntie she like when we go like grocery shopping or something she'll say "look at the back at the calorie log" and i'll look at it and i'll be like "how do you read ? so
331	c: how important do you think it is to have that ?
112	t: counting ? it's important 'cause it's how much you eat and how much sugars or fat or anything that's in the food 17:35 what you put into your body
334	c: right right have you ever had the experience where you eat a small piece of food but it has a lot of calories in ?
117	t: yes
333	c: and then what about if the opposite like you have a bigger piece of food that doesn have
112	t: has less calories
333	c: what's an example of a time that that happened to ?
119	t: like i ate like a i think it was a cookie and it was like a little cookie like i ate half of it and then later i ate the other half of it and it was only like less of it in the half form then you put it both together and it was kinda more of it
313	c: oh okay so you saw that having a smaller portion gave you smaller calories
333	c: would you have gotten just as filled up if you had like an apple even a big apple do you ?
112	t: yeah if i ate a whole apple i'll get full and probably i won eat nothing else for two three hours
308	c: wow that's pretty good to know about yourself
331	c: do you feel like apples have more or less calories than ?
112	t: it feels like it has less calories 'cause it's healthy
311	c: yeah yeah so apples have less calories than cookies and it sounds like they really fill you up too so that's a really handy thing to know ? laughs
305	c: okay well so if you and i want to come up with a plan that you can take home and use would that be okay with ?
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: okay i do have one that we can use if you'd like to take a look at it see this is a blank one you and i would have to either fill it out or talk through it basically this is a little plan that we have to help people put their ideas down on paper or at least put them in their heads and so what we could do is decide what your plan is that you'd like to do and you mentioned logging and learning how to count calories we talk about why it is important to you that you write that down and then an important part is knowing what the barriers might be meaning knowing what could stop you from being able to use your plan
301	c: so why is that so important to ?
120	t: right it down ?
301	c: yeah so you can write it down it in this section right here
302	c: alrighty so you have an important goal and you have an important reason for doing your goal or for trying to achieve your goal now what about this ? no matter how much somebody wants to do something there could be things that could make it difficult or that could even stop them from doing it
344	c: can you think of anything that would stop you from logging and learning how to count ?
120	t: write it ?
308	c: sure yeah you have lots of good ideas
120	t: hey so you write down what gets on the way like if you have something else to ?
326	c: that could be one thing
305	c: would it be helpful for you to just talk about it for a minute and then write it ?
117	t: yeah
309	c: okay so that's a really good point
302	c: so for some people they might be in a rush or have something else to do and so they don have time to do their logging so that would be one thing that could get in the way it might not always but sometimes it could
344	c: but what other things prevent you from doing stuff that you really want to do like logging for ?
109	t: i might have something more important to do or the other thing that you do takes up more time like it takes half of the day you don have time to
326	c: okay so two big things i hear you saying is other things to do and not enough time
344	c: can you think of anything else that would stop ?
109	t: patience
305	c: okay so like if you would you run out of patience is that what you're ?
117	t: yeah
344	c: okay so what other things can you think ?
308	c: you have three really great ideas
117	t: that's about it
301	c: okay so what if you were to write down those three things other things to do not enough time and ?
308	c: okay so you came up with some really good ideas
302	c: and i hear these things a lot from people that if they're going to get slowed down by something those are the kind of things that will make it difficult for them to reach their goal
333	c: so if you think about each of those three things time patience and other things to do if one of those started to come up or you thought it might get in your way what do you think you could do to stop it from getting in your ?
106	t: do it at a time where you have time and patience
313	c: okay so it almost looks like you'd have to pick a time during the day you know would work better for you
308	c: okay that's a really great solution make it easy on yourself ?
331	c: can you think of anything else that would help ?
117	t: no
302	c: okay if i could make one suggestion would that be ? so some people find that when they start to run out of patience that if they keep working that they really really run out of patience and so sometimes it's okay just to set it aside for a minute and say "you know ? i'm just getting upset here i'm going to take a break for about five minutes and then come back and try again" and they might even just ask somebody to help them so you could say like for example
331	c: your mom helps you out a ?
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: you might say "mom i'm having a really hard time figuring out the calories in this meal can you help ? and those might be helpful things
305	c: could you see those working for ?
117	t: yes
301	c: okay so you know let's see we have here the first step you can take today to reach your goal
305	c: so if your goal overall is to start logging each day and to learn how to do calorie counting so that you can put that on your log what do you think the very first thing you would do today ?
106	t: go find a journal and write down what i eat and what time and how many calories
313	c: okay alright so the very first thing is to get a journal
308	c: you know what i really like about what you said about finding a journal is that you ha- it almost seems like you have this idea that "if i'm going to do this i'm going to do it for real i'm going to get a journal where there are lots of pages 'cause i'm going to fill them up" so that's a really great way to start out is knowing already that you're going to stick with it
331	c: so what about somebody who can help ?
301	c: in this bottom part what you will put here is something like a person's name or relationship to you could do to help me reach my goal
120	t: can you put more than one ?
301	c: mm-hmm yeah you can put as many people as you want
120	t: 27:57
331	c: what do you think they would do to help you reach your ?
305	c: what would you want them to do for ?
311	c: so let's see can i look at what you wrote ?
331	c: thanks so let's see "help watch what i eat and how much" so you're really feeling like you could use some help with some people kind of do you want them to watch over or do you just want to check in with ?
112	t: both
311	c: both okay so you really see that it's going to take a lot of people to help you out and i think you're right
302	c: anytime people make big changes it does take a lot of people; it's harder to do on your own than it is when you have lots of people helping you
308	c: so that's a super good thought
310	c: so this log right here you can take home with you also and this might be enough to get you started at least for a couple of meals 'cause you have things down on each of the lines so until you get a journal this will give you a good start anyways
306	c: okay so what questions can i answer for you about your plan or about other things we've talked ?
120	t: do you have a food ? like the food
331	c: like a ?
117	t: yeah
302	c: i don i might be able to find one for you though so maybe before you leave i can try to look one up on the internet and print it out for you
117	t: okay
308	c: ? that's a really good question
331	c: are you familiar with my ?
117	t: yeah
331	c: yeah what do you like about ?
112	t: i like the way like it tells you like what it is and how much calories it is and the colors
309	c: oh okay okay good point
301	c: so well from here what i usually do is i take 30:07 into the waiting room and our research assistants who worked with you earlier they might have something for you to do but i'm going to meet with your mom for a few minutes now if you would like to share this plan with your mom we could do it in a couple different ways one way is to just wait until all three of us come back together and you can share it with your mom another way that some people like to do is to have me share it with her and then to talk about it again when the three of you come back together
305	c: what would work best for ?
117	t: i really don know
305	c: okay well do you feel comfortable with me talking it over with your mom so that she has an idea of what you've been working ?
117	t: yeah
305	c: okay would you be okay with me showing her what you worked ?
301	c: okay so then what i'll do is i'll talk with her a little bit about it and she and i will come up with a plan too for her and for how she can help you and when the three of us come back together what i'll do is one of the things i'll do actually is ask you if you would share your plan with your mom knowing that she's already seen it so that'll be a little bit easier to kind of go through it with her say what you'd like to work on and what you're hoping to get out of that meaning to be more healthy and find it easier to do the things you want to do
306	c: ? do you have any ?
117	t: no
308	c: okay you've been very very helpful you seem to know a lot about this you definitely have a lot of people ready to help you out on everything
301	c: i'll just put these back together and then i will take you in the other room lose track of my pen too here it is alrighty
