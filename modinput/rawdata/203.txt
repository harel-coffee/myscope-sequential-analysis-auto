345 c: toya and sarah yeah they'll let you know what happen out there laughter how it go ?
117 t: all right
327 c: cool got done with summer school and here you come for more stuff to do more work
117 t: yeah
301 c: well we have some time today to kind of talk about thing have to do with nutrit and activ
343 c: and i just want to know how do you feel about your weight ?
112 t: i mean like like i don't know how to put it but like sometim i be mad becaus like like me and my friend will be play at hide and seek like sometim i be the one to get caught sometim they'll be the one to get caught
311 c: so it kind of interfer sometim with play with your friend
111 t: sometim but not a whole lot what els ?
331 c: so there a littl bit there with just be around your friend
117 t: that about it like that about it
310 c: so for the most part you'r pretti comfort with your weight
117 t: well
329 c: you as i didn't get it i'm sorri
360 c: you are you are pretti as you are unsur about whi you'r here to talk to me ?
116 t: oh i'm okay with it
329 c: okay so it not a big deal that we'r here to talk about it
302 c: well i have some inform relat to whi you might be here today and it has someth to do with someth call your bodi mass index do you want to hear about that ?
116 t: it okay
310 c: and i guess when you say it okay i don't know if you mean like it okay i don't want to hear about it or it okay i do want to hear about it
305 c: and this is realli kind of like your show so if we'r talk about someth that you don't like or it bore or anyth like that you can be like "kati let move on"
306 c: okay doe that make sens ?
117 t: mm-hmm
302 c: so would that be someth you'd like to see or not realli ?
111 t: i mean like i can
331 c: okay cool so what if anyth have you heard about bodi mass index or bmi ?
119 t: this is my first time ever hear about it
302 c: all right so it a new thing all right well to kind of put us on the same page your bodi mass index or your bmi actual talk about as it a number that talk about what your weight is in ratio to your height and then they take that number and they tell you what your diseas risk might be in relat to your weight so at your age you'r actual plot on a growth chart you are compar to all the guy that are your age so when we look at the growth chart here you actual fall for other boy your age abov the 99 percentil in term of your weight or your bodi mass index and that put you right here in this gray no dark gray area mean that out of 100 boy your age you would weigh more than about 99 of them and your diseas risk would be a littl bit elev becaus you'r in this gray area
324 c: so not too interest
120 t: so this is where i should be at and this is where i am at or this is where i should be at this is where i am ?
307 c: oh so it a littl confus to look at it
329 c: so i didn't do a good job of explain
302 c: well this idea here is that this lighter area down here would be consid of a healthi weight rang this is a healthi weight rang and this would be kind of get higher and then this would be increas risk of diseas relat to your weight
120 t: so this is where i am at but this is =
302 c: you'r this one right here
120 t: and i should be right here ?
302 c: bring this down into other area
310 c: becaus you'r kind of interest in how to get into a healthier place or where you should be
302 c: okay so yeah bring this part down actual decreas your possibl risk for diseas and what would you =
119 t: so the light shade part should be right here
302 c: so it more that this isn't a veri good pictur
119 t: i just don't know how to read it
329 c: again i'm not do a veri good job of explain am i
120 t: i mean you is as it probabl just me
308 c: not at all
302 c: so what this is say is you'r right and you'r say that you as peopl who are in a healthi weight rang are in this area down here and then as they get up higher into the darker rang up here then it a less as it not as much of a healthi weight so peopl that drop their weight or drop their bmi into a healthier rang have better health
306 c: how is that make sens ?
120 t: so like this black line would be me ?
302 c: so this the dark one that go through is kind of throw us a bit it actual this is where you'r at right now you'r this dot up here and you know your age and appli your bmi
120 t: and i should be right here ?
311 c: and you'r interest in how to get as where you should fall
302 c: and fall into a lower part even if it not all the way down here will be healthier for you
306 c: so what do you make of that info ?
120 t: um i got anoth question too how much overweight am i ?
305 c: you actual want to hear some kind of a number or just an idea of how much overweight that you are ?
111 t: like an idea
311 c: like an idea
302 c: well if you were to be in this rang right here becaus this is your age come up here right if you were to be bring this down into this rang like that lighter part that would put you at overweight into this overweight rang and then if you bring it into this other part down here that would be more into that would be a normal weight rang
308 c: i'm realli impress with how mani question you'r ask to make sure that you understand this inform you know i work with a lot of peopl and they just look at this and they say "oh yeah yeah sure i understand" and you know you'r realli check in and ask some great question so that it clear for you
306 c: so what do you what do you think about that info of see where you'r at and kind of think about weight and stuff ?
115 t: i think that i need to tri and lose it but like last time where i went they had they gave me some inaud thing to do but i didn't see the video on there
310 c: so somebodi talk to you about this befor and you tri to use whatev they gave you
112 t: yeah and it didn't work
312 c: and it didn't work
307 c: and that was pretti frustrat becaus here you took the time to look for it it wasn't there
333 c: all right well what other thing have you tri =
106 t: like me and my friend like we run around a lot but not a lot but like we play manhunt and like my other friend dog get out sometim and we ran after the dog a lot but like sometim you just walk around be like as from my grandma hous i walk to my summer school and that as my grandma hous is like you know where atworth is at ? well my grandma hous is close to inaud and i got to walk down to west grand boulevard then walk back home
313 c: so there are time in your day that you'r be activ whether it run around with your friend and the fact that you have to get yourself to summer school
310 c: but it also that you kind of mention that you'r sometim be activ so there might be a littl bit of room for you to be more activ if you want to
302 c: so activ is one thing that you'r definit that peopl do in order to help to manag their weight and to lose weight and the other side of that would be the nutrit part
301 c: so we have a chanc to kind of talk about either of them today
305 c: which would you like to talk about ?
112 t: me and like lose weight
360 c: you'r not quit sure whi as what we mean by like the nutrit activ for weight loss ?
119 t: i thought like that fall up under lose weight
302 c: so it the idea that some peopl are as will do thing to you know increas their activ or choos the type of thing that they'r eat in order to lose some weight
305 c: so which one do you want to talk about today if ani of them becaus again like i said this is realli kind of for you and you might be at a place where you'r not even sure again whi you'r here or whi we'r talk about weight loss in the first place
117 t: i would i don't know
325 c: you'r not sure what you want to talk about
305 c: would it be all right with you if i put this away for now or do you want to keep it out to look ?
117 t: you can
324 c: funni look camera
332 c: laugh so if you were to you know think about where you see yourself in about five year or so and you didn't make ani chang to your weight what do you see happen ?
112 t: i mean like everybodi say that you can die from be overweight so mayb death
311 c: so pretti serious effect of weight and other peopl are talk to you about that
116 t: like my stepdad he talk to me about it he be like he be like you could die from it you could have a heart attack and all that but like he say it so much to the point like as like when he said it to me he normal say that he be make fun of it but now that he said it like sometim i take it serious and sometim i don't becaus like how do i know you not play and he a good actor so
325 c: so he kind of goof around a lot and you'r not realli sure if what he say is true
311 c: but it someth that he bring up quit a bit =
119 t: well he most say it like like if he just got done drink like on father day i mean not father day the day when the basketbal game had came on he was drink like he done brung it up so i look at him like "ain't nobodi in the mood to play whi you talk to me about this"
328 c: so he act up a littl bit and he kind of know how to pick at certain topic that might bother you but you'r abl to defend yourself get around it but it still bother you a littl bit that that what he goe for other peopl in your famili are talk about weight too
106 t: like they tell me like they be like "malik you need" as like my grandma she tell me sometim like "malik you look like you slim down" which is i have becaus like all of my cloth feel a lot bigger and like when i was around like 230 like last summer i went to the doctor i was like almost like 242 or someth like that and like sinc i did that i been run around cut grass all of that so like i guess it all add up like all of my cloth like sometim i use to be abl to just fold down the top of them but now they still come out
313 c: so you made some chang last summer after go to the doctor and see your weight and it sound like you are be more activ and you'r see the differ in your cloth along with other peopl notic too
308 c: so wow so you made chang and saw some result yeah
313 c: and you mention you know some activ stuff
333 c: what other stuff are you do ?
106 t: like just run around a lot and play manhunt hide and seek and tag and all of the other stuff
313 c: so be activ with your friend is one way that you you know help with weight loss
333 c: so what other thing ?
104 t: inaud i mean sometim like like i be outsid but like a lot of time it on the comput and stuff
314 c: so you'r notic that while sometim in your day you are out a lot of time you'r sit around and do thing that are less activ
105 t: i mean like it it half and half but most of the time i'm outsid becaus like the comput get bore now so most of the time i just go outsid
313 c: so plus with the comput but it still there and you'r notic that the less time that you'r spend on the comput or other yon know kind of sit around thing the more you happen to be outsid and move around
308 c: that pretti interest becaus you know it sound like you alreadi know one of the great way that peopl help to lose weight and that to cut down on their sedentari activ you know that idea of like watch tv and play game and be on the comput
105 t: but like when i'm at my granni hous the onli activ that i realli do now is like take out the trash like if she need to get inaud go to the store for her but and stuff like that but like over there i don't have =
308 c: you'r a good grandson aren't you
120 t: i'm all right like sometim she just flip though like me and her we be go at it but i like stay at my grandmoth hous more than i like stay at home
312 c: so it good to be over there but like you were say
329 c: befor i interrupt you i'm sorri
312 c: was that there aren't a lot of peopl over there for you to play with
106 t: i mean my godsist and them live down there but they older so like we don't realli play but like my niec she i think three so like i run around outsid with her like she like "i bet you can't get me" so i run out there but like sometim she be on her bike and then i give her a headstart and then i run after her i let her get like four or five hous ahead of me and then i run after her
313 c: so while it not the same as be with your friend you get to hang out with some more of the famili and play with your niec
117 t: yeah
309 c: a good uncl
304 c: but you are notic that even you know when you'r at the place you like to be at your grandma more than you like to be at home you'r be less activ
106 t: i mean i'm still activ but like like i just don't do the same like i'll say out of a hundr i do like 60% of what i do at home
304 c: okay yeah so you'r definit over that half of the amount that you'r do at home but you'r see that there that 40% differ with what you would normal do when you'r at home and the fact that you'r notic it is you know interest =
106 t: and like at home like we don't realli play for team like footbal team and that like we all boy and like ain't none of us scare to get hurt break a bone or anyth so like we go down the street and we play tackl and stuff
310 c: so when you'r at home with all your friend it you know pretti heavi duti you can do more of the sport and thing that you can't do at your grandma
106 t: mm-hmm but like at my grandma i can still like throw the ball and then test my run to see how fast i can catch the ball and stuff and plus i notic that i lost weight becaus it was like like i never been abl to jump as high as i can now
313 c: so your cloth are fit you differ and you'r see that you'r abl to you know play sport a littl bit better jump higher and do thing differ with the weight loss well you know we'r talk a lot about activ today and a lot of realli posit thing that you'r do
305 c: so it sound like you know activ might be more of the thing that you would like to do in order to think about mayb focus on the weight if that what you want to do as oppos to like talk about eat and nutrit
114 t: well like with eat and like like i like eat fruit and veget but like sometim like sometim i just come in the hous and i just want to eat and like if i wake up in the middl of the night and i get hungri then i eat
310 c: so sometim when you'r just come home and and you'r hungri and so you don't necessarili pay as much attent to like portion or thing you just want to eat what you want to eat
112 t: like if i went outsid right now and i was hungri i would probabl come in the hous probabl make me like a bowl of cereal or eat a hot dog drink some water and go back outsid or either just eat an orang or appl and just go back outsid
311 c: so kind of go in there eat someth get back outsid
103 t: but like sometim like my friend inaud he stay on punish if it was a world longest you could have been on punish he would have broke it so like sometim his mom will let him do stuff and sometim she don't but so like sometim if i'm hungri like i be so bore in the hous becaus like i like been on the comput a lot so they take the mous so like like i eat and then like i lay down and then i say i'm go to have to watch tv or play the game and then befor i do that i end up go to sleep so
314 c: so peopl in the hous are actual tri to cut down on the comput time and they'll take the mous away from you so you can't use it and then if you'r bore you eat and it make you tire
116 t: no i don't eat becaus i'm bore i just eat like if i get hungri then i eat but i'm like if i was at home right now and i was bore i wouldn't just go in the hous like hungri and just eat someth
310 c: so it not realli you know it more that you'r just kind of sit around you get sleepi and you lay down becaus your friend when he on punish can't hang out and play
109 t: i mean i got a lot more other friend but like sometim walk around the corner a lot of time get bore and plus my friend bernard he alway got his compani over like his girlfriend or best friend or whatev we get tire of all as i get tire as we get tire of hang with her all the time becaus like she be over today she be like oh well i'm about readi to go home by the time we alreadi leav or someth she right back over there like she know where inaud hous is so she'll come to one of our hous
327 c: you can't get rid of her
120 t: right she like she like a fli on a sticki plant
312 c: laugh that pretti serious huh so you can't realli play tackl in the middl of the street if she hang around all the time
109 t: yeah plus like like even if we do like she be get on my nerv becaus like she be like oh you weeni you couldn't tackl him and like to me she a pain in the butt
312 c: and so you don't realli want to be around them as much
120 t: well like i i toler her becaus i don't know how to say it but like her mama abandon her like one time her mama told her like "man i don't even want you i just want you for your daddi child support or to get food stamp and stuff" it like i toler her but after a while sometim like we just argu a lot
312 c: so you know all in all you tri to be nice with her but she kind of get in the way of you play be with your friend and do a lot of the thing the activ thing that you and your friend like to do
307 c: that can be pretti annoy
333 c: so how do you you know get around thing like when you'r at your grandma hous and there not as much as you know that your friend aren't around to be activ with or the girl hang around and you know if you still want to be activ how do you get around all that stuff ?
106 t: i mean i just be like let run form her or someth becaus like sometim like befor we get readi to go outsid she normal be like "oh let me go to the bathroom so i won't have to use one while we'r at the park" or whatev so i be like "let just run let just run to a certain like stink and then we can go the park for like five minutes" and then by the time we see her again we'll just run becaus like he live on as he live like four hous away from puritan and like i say like we run to like almost to 6 mile and then like we'll stop
313 c: so it buy you a littl more time while she tri to catch up and it also that you'r run around more with that
106 t: but like sometim sometim like right direct after school i go to my friend bernard hous and i help him with his chore and then we get readi to leav back out go get our other friend from rechard he live closer to our school i think like probabl a block or two away from bernard hous and then we go back on 6th mile then we go play at the park
313 c: so again when you'r at home with your friend you realli are move around to a lot of place when you get out and be with them becaus you'r alway travel around and go from one place to anoth and you know walk and run when you'r do all that
117 t: yeah
331 c: well on a scale of like you know one to ten where one would be not at all import and ten would be veri import like super super import how import is it for you to find way to be activ when you know you can't play as much with your friend or you'r at your grandma hous ?
106 t: like it import like like it real import but like sometim like run up and down her stair she got like 17 stair to get upstair on the top floor so like run up and down the stair that still a good way to get activ or like like sometim she be like "go trim the bushes" or either right befor she just got her lawnmow fix she'd be like "go cut the grass" stuff like that
313 c: so she give you a lot a lot of chore to do around that keep you keep you move
112 t: uh-huh and i'm go to have like more becaus i think for tenth grade i think i'm to live back with my grandma
311 c: uh-huh all right so that go to kind of keep it go for a while
331 c: yeah so you said that it import but what number would you put it on with that =
112 t: seven and a half
311 c: like a seven and a half
331 c: well what you know make it a seven and a half and not like a five ?
114 t: becaus like i like i feel the import as i feel that it is import to get activ but then on the other hand i can't becaus it not that much to do and like i run around the corner over there but like her area is so bad like you run around the corner and you even say hi and then that take you to anoth way i'm go to have to blow your head off like somebodi over there they just got rob and shot like last week so like i just stay to myself over there
310 c: so safeti a pretti big issu so you'r realli think about the fact that you'r kind of stuck when you'r over there and you'r not =
120 t: but like it fun if you go there becaus like over at my hous the onli peopl that around my age is bernard and rashad my friend tete he all right but like i love laugh and like sometim he get on my nerv becaus he as i think he could be funni but like when he be make joke he gotta put on like sound effect and all that into it so =
327 c: it not your style you don't think =
120 t: yeah so like and nichola he all right but like if we go over and sit like his best friend hous or my best friend hous he'll be like "eewww whi you hang with her" ? but like he be play but like inaud on the other hand like you can say hi and he be like "whi you talk to me about hi" ? or like he gotta put all that extra stuff in it to make me not want to be around him
327 c: got a lot of attitud so so you'r over there at your grandma becaus you'r kind of not with all those peopl and you'r not realli as annoy but you at the same time =
120 t: like sometim my friend bernard he do be get on my nerv becaus like i could say someth like i could be talk real fast and i could be like ahhhh like i just say someth then he'll remix and then i'll be like "i didn't say that" or like or like sometim you just gotta laugh him off and then he'll be like "yeah thought you'd laugh"
327 c: so there a lot go on with your friend over there and sometim it nice to =
120 t: but i also like be at my grandma hous becaus my mama she not drive so therefor i see my grandma like i wouldn't even say onc a month like probabl onc everi three month
327 c: if you'r not stay there you don't get to see her veri often
117 t: yeah
310 c: so safeti realli and not realli have stuff to do when you'r over at your grandma is one of the reason that you know you'r not necessarili a higher number on that import thing
114 t: but then like at my hous like like a boy that i don't like to come in around about like 9:00 becaus then like i still want to run around and stuff so like at that time that time for me to start wire down but like i still want to be outsid and stuff and like at that time everybodi they gotta be on they block or someth like close to somebodi that they know becaus like over there a lot of abandon hous over there as my grandma like it this abandon hous on the corner with the door kick all the way in front door side door and back door and then it anoth hous that burn down and then like two more hous down it anoth hous is burn down
325 c: so safeti is also an issu kind of in your neighborhood it kind of cramp your style a bit becaus you'd like to be out later and run around and thing so it kind of the same not quit as bad as your gram
331 c: then if you realli were go to kind of bump yourself up to from like a seven and a half to like an eight and a half or a nine as far as import to find activ that you could do at your grandma or at home what would it take to bump you up ?
106 t: like probabl just i don't know she make me do a lot for her so like run up and down the stair wash the cloth go in the basement go put it insid the dryer and stuff so that a lot
310 c: so you'r pretti happi with the amount of activ that you'r do over there even though it about 60% of what you'r do when you'r home you'r still pretti good with it
117 t: all right
327 c: you'r the vip over there ?
120 t: mm-mm that my friend all right
301 c: we don't have a ton of time left just for like you and i to talk befor we switch with your mom
302 c: and a lot of time when i meet with peopl we go ahead and write down a littl bit of a plan in term of what they'd like to do to kind of keep up with their you know or think about weight loss or work on it
306 c: what would you think about do someth like that ?
111 t: like work on i mean it all right
328 c: so we talk a lot today about realli focus on activ stuff you'r do at home and stuff you'r do at your grandma and you know this idea about you you know are pretti activ there are some thing that kind of get in your way sometim and you'v notic that be activ actual realli help you with the weight loss

115 t: like it noth els to do so so like i think that about it
325 c: what you'r do right now is is pretti much all that you could do there noth els left
313 c: so it a matter of for you stick with what you'r alreadi do to kind of keep up with your weight loss that you'r see and the cloth be looser and the fact that you'r jump higher and thing
306 c: so what type of thing with that ?
301 c: let me grab a pen okay ? got it
120 t: write what my plan is and stuff ?
305 c: again you don't have to do it for me
333 c: so what have you got so far ?
313 c: all right so you'r say that you want to make your activ more activ
306 c: what do you mean by that ?
106 t: like like make them more funner so like like find basic find more stuff to do
