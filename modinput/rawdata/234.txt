328 c: okay alright so one thing i hear you say is that you have some idea you have some thing that you'v done i mean you have a desir to work out to chang your weight but sometim it come right down to it time to work out and you just don't feel like it
331 c: how success has it been so far do you think ?

346 c: in the past how long ?
119 t: like two week
328 c: okay alright so you'v got some activ routin that you do and some peopl that help you by tri to motiv you
302 c: when peopl think about you know the thing that they do for weight loss and what they need to do they often come up with a coupl differ thing
313 c: you'v alreadi mention physic activ so peopl becom more activ and it sound like that someth that alreadi in place for you
302 c: and peopl also make anoth chang they usual chang what they eat or how much they eat
305 c: is that someth that you'v thought about ?
106 t: i don't tri to chang what i eat but i do cut down on my limit
343 c: okay can you tell me a littl bit about that ?
106 t: like i don't be 6:28 like if i had like a plate or someth like 6:32 i'll finish and i'll probabl go back and get some more like i don't know whi i just want to eat like i'v cut down on that and i'v cut down on like all how much i 6:42 put on my plate that what i do
313 c: okay so you'r cut down on portion
346 c: and if you were to think about how success you'v been with that cut down on your portion as well as your physic activ that you'v been do which of those would you say is most success ?
112 t: my portion
311 c: your portion okay
305 c: and so if i was to help you realli focus in on someth today that you could plan for that you think would be the most help to you in the futur what would you want to work on ?
111 t: i guess tri to exercis a littl bit more
302 c: okay alright so what if we talk about thing that you could do and i have some inform in here that i can show you if you'r interest
306 c: so do you know what that mean when i say high intens ?
302 c: so peopl who think about low medium and high intens activ as be like you know the song peopl sing happi birthday when somebodi has a birthday if you were sing that song and you were abl to sing it pretti comfort you'd be do like mild intens activ and if you were abl to sing it but you have to take extra breath so it wouldn't be realli smooth that would be like moder or medium intens activ and if you could onli say it and you'd probabl have to take some breath there too then that more like high intens activ okay ? so that someth that you might give it a tri just to kind of see where you'r at and if you need to improv the intens of your activ okay ? so in the 60-minut period you might think about 20 minut of stretch on either end 20 minut of strength train and aerob activ and this is where the weight loss will realli come into play is with the aerob activ that you do but these other thing help too
117 t: okay
310 c: okay ? and then the other option i was go to show you is this is a physic activ log where you could just keep track of what you do and that way you'd know whether it need to increas or decreas over time
117 t: mm-hmm
306 c: doe that make sens ?
117 t: yeah
329 c: yeah so here a space for each day of the week and you could write down what and this say lifestyl activ becaus we recogn that not everybodi has a workout that they do but peopl are sometim activ in other way too so you'd write down what you did how long you did it for how vigor it was so you'd say easi medium if it vigor yeah it doe say that there but i'm have a hard time read them upsid down
306 c: and are you familiar with calori burn at all ?
117 t: mm-hmm
310 c: okay so if you have a sens of how mani calori you burn then you could write that down too which might help you keep track
117 t: okay
302 c: then this final column say how long would i watch tv ? but it might not be just tv it could be anyth that involv like sit or not be veri activ so read which is healthi in some way caus it work out your mind but not so much your bodi same with tv and video game so kind of like comput time
310 c: so if you were to circl for yourself 30 minut for each tv you could start to get a sens of whether this need to decreas whether this time spent be activ need to increas
305 c: okay ? so of these two thing to focus on just kind of general make improv or realli keep close track of what you'r do are either of these idea one that you might want to tri ?
117 t: mm-hmm
112 t: the 11:04 one
305 c: okay okay and you can tri both i'm not go to stop you laugh i mean ultim like i said it your show
301 c: so but sinc you kind of have a prefer for this one whi if we focus on this one today and i'm go to give you these other thing to take home with you so you can look at them okay ? and today with our idea it just kind of give you some place to start so that you have kind of a plan in place that you can begin with and build up
311 c: so it seem like this is pretti import to you
331 c: whi is it so import ?
112 t: i don't know i just think i also think like at my age i shouldn't be this size i mean caus when i was younger i use to be realli realli skinni and i don't know what happen
307 c: sometim it hard to explain those thing
302 c: our bodi start to chang and we don't realli get a good sens of where that come from becaus you might not be do thing a whole lot differ or mayb you are but don't realiz it
117 t: yeah
307 c: so you'r confus by someth has chang laugh
311 c: yeah okay so it import to you becaus you would like to get your weight under control for yourself it sound like
302 c: so that can be a pretti strong motiv
112 t: i don't care what other peopl think i care what i think
308 c: mm-hmm alright well that you know if you'r go to be motiv by someth your own thought are a pretti strong one and you can realli you know do a lot with that
333 c: what do you think you might do to keep yourself go on day when you don't feel like it ? like do your workout

112 t: i feel pretti good
360 c: yeah ?
106 t: i'm final do it
333 c: well if i was to ask you to rate it say on a scale of one to ten with one be "you know i don't know what this ladi is talk about i'm leav here laugh not do anything" and ten be "yeah you know what ? i can't wait to get home and start this i'm go to start record my thing on my sheet the minut i get home" where would you fall ?

333 c: when you think about what it mean like when you think in your head to get down and start do more thing to help me what specif come to mind ? like what are you what do you pictur yourself do ?
103 t: i'll be like just eat
328 c: okay okay so a minut ago we were talk about use littl 19:51 form to keep track of your physic activ
348 c: but you'r kind of lead more toward make some chang with your eat right ?
117 t: mm-hmm
309 c: okay so and that fine
305 c: i mean like i said laugh this is your these are your idea
333 c: so if you think about make chang with what you'r eat or how you eat what specif would you like to start with do
112 t: i think fast food
330 c: okay
103 t: like fast food and junk food caus i know i would eat fast food like that and i'll eat like junk food
311 c: okay so you want to cut down on fast food and junk food
306 c: particular junk food right ?
333 c: so when you say cut down what do you see yourself do differ ?
106 t: stop tri to stop go to the store and buy chip and everi singl candi 20:35
309 c: okay so there that pretti specif
301 c: so you might say "i'm go to be do more thing to help me such as not go to the store to buy chip and candi okay ? yeah just tuck it under
305 c: and i think you know you tell me what you think
309 c: but it seem like this fit pretti well
306 c: i mean you could still say that you want to stop go to the store and buy junk food becaus you want to lose weight right ?
117 t: mm-hmm
301 c: okay so now that we know that we have a veri detail plan about what specif chang you want to make right now now you can think more care about someth that could get in your way
344 c: so what might stop you from hold back when you want to go to the store ?
112 t: i think my sister laugh my sister 22:02 "don't eat this" or me i think i'm go to stop the soda too caus i don't realli need that 22:13
311 c: okay so two thing that you mention is that one your sister might be abl to help you by say "you don't realli need to do that" and you might be abl to say that to yourself too so those are thing that could help you
344 c: but what might get in your way ? like if you want to stop yourself from go to the store what might happen that would caus you to go anyway ?
109 t: i think just i just want it caus it's-how can-i just want it crave right now just wanna go to get it
309 c: i think you just said a key word
360 c: did you pick up on it when you said it ?
117 t: yeah
347 c: what was it ?
119 t: crave
302 c: yeah so and crave can be veri difficult to deal with you know lot of peopl struggl with crave and if you'r interest we can talk a littl bit about crave okay so you know if you think about when you have a crave it usual for a specif food
103 t: i get 23:21 like candi
302 c: so someth sweet okay the good news about crave is they realli are just crave it not someth your bodi has to have and they do go away like if you ever find yourself in a posit where you realli want a candi bar like realli bad but you weren't in a posit to get one caus either you didn't have the money to get one on you or like it was the begin of the day at school and you knew it was go to be like six hour befor you could go so you'd just have to wait right
117 t: yeah
331 c: what did you do to make that crave go away ?
119 t: 23:58 like when i was at school so i just thought like i just stop think about it do my work start listen
331 c: so how did you stop think about it ?
120 t: teacher ask me a question laugh i was in math and i didn't get it so i just i told him i didn't get it i thought "alright" i actual listen and stop think about it
346 c: so the question it seem was someth that distract you from the crave ?
117 t: mm-hmm
311 c: okay so now we have anoth key word and that a distract
310 c: so if mayb we can think about it like this like if you mention that a crave could get in your way so we might say if a crave get in the way then i could tri someth that would be distract you might have to i don't know what would be distract for you but so you might have to think of some idea
120 t: okay i realli don't know how to spell crave
330 c: oh c-r-a-v-i-n-g
117 t: thank you
333 c: so what did you come up with for your solut ?
106 t: i just said "talk to friend and family" or "26:53 or just think like do i realli need this" ?
309 c: great
333 c: and how comfort do you feel like those thing will realli do the trick for you ?
112 t: i feel pretti comfort caus i think like my friend are veri support and i know they'll support me and do other thing
331 c: do you feel comfort in talk to your friend about this and let them know "this is someth i'm work on i could realli use your help caus sometim i have crave and it hard for me"
117 t: mm-hmm
302 c: okay so a lot of peopl do find that social support like friend and famili is realli help to them so
344 c: okay do you feel like there is anyth els that might make it hard for you not to go to the store and get junk food ?
112 t: definit my sister
332 c: laugh okay so how would you describ that ? like how would your sister get in the way ?
112 t: probabl just keep tell me or get in front of me get in front of the door and tell me i realli don't need this
301 c: okay okay so that actual probabl will fit better down here
329 c: so i think this is word littl bit confus
344 c: like so when i say someth that could get in the way what i realli mean is what could make it hard for you to stop yourself from go to the store ? like what would make it so that you go to the store instead of hold back ?
117 t: i don't know
308 c: okay well you came up with a realli big one and that is your crave might make it hard for you to say "i'm not go to go to the store right now"
310 c: and you might think of some other thing or you might notic some other thing as you'r use your plan and then i mean it your plan you can write them down anoth time too so
305 c: the next step for us to think about is the first step for you to take in order to make this goal happen for you and right now you have a specif goal that just one part of your big plan what the first step you can do to stop yourself from go to the store for junk food ?
106 t: for me it would be like save my money like put it somewher so like i could just forget about it till i realli realli need it
308 c: that a realli great point
346 c: yeah and so if you had someth a place where you could put your money and not get it then that would make it so much easier for you wouldn't it ? do you have someth like that ?
112 t: yeah i do
346 c: what do you have ?
112 t: it actual like an old pencil sharpen like i just put it like in the bottom of the thing and like i put it up until like i realli need the money
311 c: okay so if the first step that you could take would be to start put your money in your old pencil sharpen
346 c: where would you is there someplac that you'd need to put it in order for you to be abl to get to it easili and put your money in there ?
112 t: 29:42 the top of my closet
310 c: okay so mayb that the first step for you to take is to put it up on the top of your closet and start use it okay
308 c: boy you'r just make thing happen left and right laugh
301 c: so the last thing on your plan is peopl who can help you to reach your goal and you'v mention sever differ peopl as we'v been talk
331 c: so if you were to start out by ask particular peopl for their support in some way who would you ask ?
106 t: i'd ask my famili first
331 c: okay do you have anybodi in particular in your famili that you think you could go to first ?
112 t: 30:57 my sister
301 c: okay alright so then you could put sister right there so it would read "someth my sister could do to help me reach my goal"
331 c: what is it particular that you think they could do ?
112 t: i do think they could stop me from go to the store and like encourag me to work out like they can do what they can to tri to help me tri to help me stop eat a lot of food and go to the store or not
345 c: mm-hmm and how would they do that ?
112 t: they talk to me like they talk to me like i could understand like "jacol you realli don't need these like you are tri to lose weight you'r tri to get down so whi don't you to go and do someth ? that just go to get your weight back up"
328 c: okay so a coupl thing that i realli hear you say are import to you to hear from your sister are for them to say thing to you that would motiv you one not to go to the store and two would motiv you to work out
306 c: right ?
346 c: so do you feel like you have the word that you want to say that would remind you if you were to write that down ?
120 t: yeah what they say to me ?

112 t: 33:47 said i would like them to keep say to me that i'm do good and like i want the thing but i don't have to have it and like i brought myself so far in my life make myself go back and i would just i would like them to keep say that to me
328 c: okay so you have some particular thing that would be help to you to hear that are veri motiv for you and one thing that i want to realli highlight that i heard you say is that kind of like the idea just becaus you want someth doesn't mean you have to have it you'v come so far don't go back now that kind of thing so these are kind of inspir and motiv thing that you want to hear from them
