343 c: have you ever talk to anybodi els ?
119 t: not realli about weight loss like my doctor actual she was send me stuff about this caus i had check off that i had problem with my weight in one of my chart that she had gave me i had to do a survey so not realli like go into full detail about it
327 c: okay alright well it sound like you so you haven't realli had a lot of experi talk with peopl in detail about your weight
117 t: right
305 c: and what you want to do about it and and if you want to do anyth and so you know in our convers today what i'm here to help you do is to make some of those decis mayb learn a littl bit more about what you can do and if you want to do anyth and whi so you know this is kind of your show which mean that i'm here to help you but i'm not go to tell you what to do and i'm not go to make decis for you so ultim the choic that you make are your own choic so
117 t: okay
301 c: and you know we can get start just by talk about what you think about your weight
111 t: well i mean it not realli where i want it to be becaus i have gain weight late and it kind of frustrat like when i go shop for cloth or someth oh my god i just i just had this on the other day i could fit in it but i mean it not realli a big deal where i'm stress myself out over it or anyth like that no it not
325 c: okay so you'v notic some chang and in particular the way cloth fit you and it frustrat but you don't feel like it a realli big deal okay
106 t: and i late me and my sister have been go to the gym so that kind of help a littl bit but i mean i mean it not realli a big deal for me i'm not go to go crazi if i gain a coupl of pound or anyth like that i'm still a kid so you know it not realli phase me like that
328 c: okay so overal you know it seem like you have this idea that someth probabl need to chang and that you'v done a coupl thing like go to the gym and but the big pictur for you is that i'm still young you know it probabl not that big of a deal
117 t: right
347 c: okay have you gotten that same messag from your doctor as well ?
120 t: what about the weight ? that it not a big deal ?
330 c: yep
119 t: i mean like i said we don't realli go into full detail about it or anyth so you know i realli haven't talk to her about 0:03:59
302 c: okay well i'm wonder if it would be interest to you to see where you weight fall on a graph as far as bodi mass index goe ?
346 c: are you familiar with that idea ?
120 t: no i didn't know you could put laugh like is it like go in with like other peopl weight or like where you'r suppos to be ?
305 c: 04:14 yeah yeah would you be interest in see someth like that ?
117 t: yeah
302 c: okay well so what we did today is becaus the peopl here the research assist that we work with they weigh you earlier and then what they did is they put your weight into a comput along with your height and age and everyth so if you look at where you fall on a bodi mass index which is a comput of your height and weight for your age this is where you fall
119 t: oh wow
302 c: yeah which mean that this is underweight this is averag weight and this is overweight this is obes so in the 97th percentil that pretti high it abov the 95th percentil which is the cutoff between overweight and obes
346 c: the 85th percentil is the cutoff between averag weight and overweight doe it surpris you to see that you'r up there ?
119 t: yeah laugh yeah caus i'v never seen a graph like this befor so
302 c: yeah that actual news to a lot of peopl becaus this isn't you know sometim peopl see a graph like this when they'r look at a growth chart but not alway i mean it not unusu for a person never to have seen one of these so and you can see too like along the bottom where you fall in and as you get older you can see that the bodi mass index that within the normal rang get a littl bit higher and that normal
305 c: so you know just i'm wonder what you think about where you fall on that chart and what that mean to you
112 t: well i guess it like a shock becaus like i'm head to the obes rang and i don't want to be there
302 c: well and we don't know where you'r head or how sharpli your curv is becaus we onli have one dot on here which mean we don't know if you were here or here or here the last time you know over the year and it hard to know just simpli becaus we onli have today data
117 t: right
308 c: yeah but that a realli good point is that you know you don't know where you'r head in the next few year either
117 t: mm-hmm
311 c: you know so you know so this is a bit of a shock for you to see that it up there
117 t: yeah
302 c: and peopl carri their weight differ way and so when you pictur in your mind you know what doe an obes person look like there isn't realli one shape that a person is or there isn't realli one you know weight that they have that say that they'r obes it like we said a comput and stuff so it might look differ for differ peopl
312 c: you said earlier that your weight wasn't realli that big of a deal and you know
112 t: yeah but you know it not but you know when you start look at stuff like this it start make you think like should you do someth about this ?
308 c: that a realli great question to ask yourself ?
331 c: and if you were to answer that question what would you say ?
112 t: yeah laugh yeah i need to do someth
301 c: well and earlier do you mind if i put this away ?
117 t: yeah
313 c: earlier you mention that you'v start to do someth like you work out
346 c: onc in a while did you say with your sister ?
117 t: yeah
302 c: you know and that is someth that peopl do sometim is they chang their activ level ?
331 c: so what do you think other thing are that peopl do ?
120 t: to what get lose weight ?
330 c: if they want to chang their weight yeah
104 t: eat healthier i know i need to do that i eat a lot of fast food but i'v been tri to cut down on that caus i know it can affect you bad
330 c: uh-huh
119 t: so eat healthier watch the stuff that you eat when when you eat someth like the calori or someth mayb like that on the packag that you read i'm not sure exact what to do but you know those are the basic that i alway hear other talk about
308 c: okay and so those are realli you'r right those are the two main area that peopl work on if they want to make a chang as far as their weight goeswould ?
302 c: if they want to make a chang as far as their weight goe then they focus on increas their activ and they work on chang what they eat or how they eat
305 c: so if you were to think for yourself you know if you want to do someth that would make a big chang for you what do you feel like would be the best thing to focus on ?
112 t: to cut out the fast food that that the main that like the main part of it all is to cut that out
330 c: okay
103 t: and i'll eat too mani burger laugh or whatev it like just cut out the fast food becaus i do eat it a lot and i need to stop
330 c: okay
109 t: but i think it like i think that come from it be so conveni for us to get that we just go right to it becaus it there and it quick you don't have to cook or anyth like that i think that the big thing
302 c: yeah a number of peopl do fall into that trap where it it easi to get to
308 c: but you'r right you make a veri good point when you say the calori are much higher
302 c: i do have some inform on fast food that if you would like to see it i can pull that out as well and kind of
305 c: becaus you mention that you might want to make some chang as far as eat and in particu
302 c: let start with this one i think i have anoth in here that might be use to you i'll give you a choic of a few differ one to look at
308 c: and you kind of mention a few thing that realli caught my attent which are realli great idea and that is in particular you mention fast food
117 t: mm-hmm
302 c: so if you were to think of way that you might want to focus on manag how you how you eat you could start with look at this this is a list of fast food choic the list of the type of fast food that peopl might eat and there are sever becaus there are lot of differ kind of food out there and what this doe is it give you healthier choic versus unhealthi choic if you'r go to eat out and so sometim peopl decid well i might not be abl to cut out all fast food but when i do have fast food mayb i can at least
112 t: go the healthier way right
309 c: exact yep
302 c: </sample>
103 t: yes i am addict to soda i am caffein drive me crazi and i know that realli bad my mom been tell me that i need to stop drink so much pop but it just so hard laugh it is just so hard
344 c: what do what do you find difficult about it ?
103 t: just like get away from it like i drink so much soda i tri to go to juic do juic and stuff like that but it like noth can make me feel like that caffein in me like that laugh so i don't know i just
310 c: so you see that as probabl a sourc where you know if you made some chang it could be help to you
307 c: but you have alreadi anticip that it could be quit difficult too
117 t: mm-hmm yeah
308 c: that a realli great insight
302 c: so in this set of paper this is a comparison between differ type of drink that peopl might have and it show you the size of the drink as well as how mani calori are in there and then mayb some other choic that you might make that could replac some or all of your fast food choic or your soda choic laugh and so as you can see these are the best choic becaus they have virtual no calori in them these are some good choic too though if you don't have too much
310 c: and you can kind of compar like how mani calori
302 c: and then final a third choic that i want to mention to you is just keep track of your food
117 t: mm-hmm
311 c: and you mention in particular count calori and that mayb that would be someth that would
346 c: would assist you in make differ choic
118 t: no i haven't
302 c: so basic all it is is just you write down everyth that you eat and drink even it just like a littl chees cube snack or someth you know drink or someth you just write the date and time and describ what it was and how much you had becaus portion like you can see on here the portion size is import and where it came from like did it come from a restaur ? did it come from home ? how mani calori it had you mention look at the nutrit label
117 t: mm-hmm
346 c: do you know how to find that inform ?
117 t: mm-hmm yeah
302 c: if you want to these are some option column you could say you know what you had a substitut for so if you had water instead of a soda you could write down the calori that were in the soda as well as the calori that were in the water and then you could see how mani you save which is nice i mean it realli kind of is a way of say wow you know this is what i didn't have laugh
331 c: and so some peopl find that veri help there are also some rate form for how hungri you are when you eat caus some peopl eat when they'r not hungri and know that inform what do you think that would do ?
112 t: kind of show you like you didn't need to eat then you were just eat just becaus it was there mayb yeah
309 c: exact yep same thing with food so you know when you start to realli write down what you'r do you start to see pattern that you might not otherwis see
117 t: right
305 c: so do ani of these look appeal to you as a place to start ?
112 t: well i was look at this one here
301 c: okay okay and i'm go to send all of these home with you so just becaus you say that this might be a good place to start doesn't mean that you can't add ani of these other
120 t: 15:06 move onto these or yeah i understand what you'r say
301 c: yeah great okay so i'm go to just stick these away so that they'r not
331 c: in the way yep alrighti so as you'v look over this did you see anyth that jump out at you in particular that you found 0:15:29 ?
112 t: i was just look at the healthier food like the choic that they have on here to get instead of like the unhealthi food just tri to see you know just look get an idea of what i would do in a situat where i want i feel like i want a burger but i know i shouldn't get a burger so
333 c: what do you pictur yourself do ?
106 t: i mean probabl make the if i'm realli if it someth that i realli want to do make the better decis to get someth healthi instead of you know oh just becaus i want a burger i'll just go ahead and get one but if it someth that i want to do and i i there a passion for it or whatev just go ahead and follow the healthier choic instead of go the other way
308 c: okay that sound like a realli you know good choic
313 c: as far as be abl to make an inform decis about well if i'm go to find myself here then at least i'm go to make a choic to healthi eat healthier so i can save a few calori
106 t: yeah that what i was say when i was at the gym when i'v been sinc i'v been go to the gym i'v been tell myself like i'm go to get out of this stage of have a burger and then go to the gym or eat someth that fatter that what i need to eat but i just have to like push myself like i realli want to do this so i have to get in that mind frame where this is what you want to do if you want to do it you have to go out and get it so that what i'm tri to get myself in that predica like just no just to say no
302 c: right a lot of peopl find themselv in that posit like you just discuss in that they have a choic that they want to make but sometim it hard to realli have in your head
119 t: becaus you'r so use to do the other- the opposit of what you'r tri to bring into yep
333 c: yep so what do you think peopl do when they want to make a chang and be abl to help themselv make it ?
112 t: i just say go for it like tri your hardest to stay in the mind frame of do right and make yourself better and make yourself healthi if you stay in that mind frame then you will be abl to go on and do what you want to do but if it just like too overwhelm for you to do and you just go back to the fattier food then you don't realli have too much control over yourself laugh and you'r be control by everyth els realli
308 c: so you make a realli good point and that is i heard the word feel overwhelm
117 t: mm-hmm
302 c: you know and that is that when peopl tri to make realli big chang all at onc sometim they do feel that way
117 t: right
333 c: how how do you pictur yourself be abl to manag that so that you can make healthi choic without get overwhelm ?
106 t: i think just start out with the small like small like i said i start go to the gym first and if i start see if i'm not realli see ani result from go to the gym then i know i need to focus on my food and the gym and tri to like weigh them both at the same time and yeah like i said time or someth go to the gym or i'm go to eat this after i come from the gym or befor i go to the gym just make a plan for yourself basic
308 c: what a great idea
302 c: yeah plan ahead is a realli a lot of peopl find that veri valuabl and it ?
348 c: it sound like that someth you have a littl bit of experi with ?
117 t: yeah
348 c: are you a good do you feel like you'r a good planner ?
120 t: yeah my school is base on they help their you'r plan ahead so it like a prep school so they alway have us do thing ahead of time so that where i get that from
309 c: school that a pretti good skill to have
301 c: yeah well i have a plan that if you would like to take a look at you know it kind of a skeleton plan but you can kind of fill in what you might want to focus on and whi that kind of thing would you
112 t: we can do that yeah
301 c: now some peopl take a look at this plan and they decid that what would work best for them would be just to talk about it and other peopl decid they realli would just want to have a written plan they can take home and put up somewher as a remind so this is what our plan look like
117 t: okay
305 c: how do you think you might want to use the plan ?
106 t: i think i would write it down and go over it and then tri to get myself to do it befor i'm just go to say okay i'm just go to take this plan it go to be done you have to look over someth first to get it in your head that this is what you want to do like i said befor so i think just read it over first and then take it step by step on what i want to do to get to the next part
308 c: so that sound like a great choic
305 c: would you be interest in start that now ?
117 t: mm-hmm
301 c: okay so i mean you'v kind of had a chanc to look over the plan and if it okay i'll just tell you a littl bit about each of the piec of it so usual what peopl find valuabl is to come up with a a small part of their plan so like your big goal might be to lose a certain amount of weight but this plan might be the first step you'r go to take and you mention work out and you mention also cut out some fast food calori so you might pick one of those to focus on initi and then you would write down what your plan is like and then you would say whi you want to do it so what are your person motiv for want to do that particular stuff ? ani good plan involv plan ahead for problem that come up as you probabl know from school yep so we would tri to identifi the major problem that might get in your way and develop a plan in case they come up so that you'll have someth readi you can just look at your chart and say exact yep and then this is an import part too i think you know is just have in mind what the veri first thing that you can do when you leav here today to get start in work toward your plan ? and then final a section on social support becaus it so much easier to do a plan and be success when you have somebodi who there to support you or help you in some way so we alway encourag peopl to kind of get some other involv and so
112 t: like i said i have my older sister go with me to the gym and stuff like that
308 c: perfect exampl
117 t: so yeah
301 c: yep and so we might just say like what specif you would ask her to do for exampl
305 c: so what do you think ? what do you think your would be your overal 0:22:08
120 t: my overal goal ?
301 c: yep and then the small one after
112 t: my overal goal i think i want to lose about i'd say 30 pound about 30 pound thirti pound
330 c: okay
106 t: and my plan after that is like basic i alreadi start my plan by go to the gym but i also want to like i said get rid of the fast food so i think yeah it to cut out that fast food that realli the big problem like the gym it not a it not a big like i can go whenev i want becaus i have this membership now
330 c: okay
112 t: so but the food that the big problem that the big issu
311 c: right it sound like what i'm realli hear you say is that that someth you realli need to plan ahead for and have someth that you can follow to keep you on track
301 c: well if you would like to i can help you come up with a plan for work on fast food and then you'll have someth you can walk away with today in hand to get you start
112 t: alright we can do that yeah
333 c: so then what would you say here about fast food ? like what specif is your plan for fast food ?
105 t: basic just to cut down on it yeah to cut down i'm not go to say i'm go to complet get fast food out of my life caus i know that not go to happen but just to cut back a littl bit on it not eat it as much as i do now but just cut down a littl bit on it
333 c: okay and would it help you to be ani more specif about in what way you want to cut down or kind of describ you know a littl more detail about when you say cut down what particular do you mean about that ?
105 t: to cut down it to like basic i just want to not eat so much of it in one day mayb have like one meal from a fast food restaur or probabl like three time a week or someth like that just get a plan on like how mani time to eat it or you know stuff like that i have to like realli think about like a real plan to like cut down on it instead of just say cut down on it
301 c: yeah and that what i'm here to help you with
308 c: becaus you'r right you know when you have more detail then it easier in the moment to to know whether or not you'v met your plan your goal or not you know caus you'd have some object measur
117 t: mm-hmm
328 c: so yeah so i'm go to give you a second to think about it caus i can see the wheel
308 c: and you have and you have some veri clear idea and i think you'r do a great job so i don't want to get in your way laugh
110 t: mmm i can't think of anyth i'm just think to reduc pop into my head so that what is in that what i'm think right now
301 c: well you know you did mention some thing earlier that if it would help you we can talk through a littl bit and then you can make a choic
310 c: so you mention the idea that you feel like you drink too much pop and when a person out at a fast food restaur that pretti avail
106 t: i mean like the plan would be to like basic it to choos the healthier side of thing to get more healthier basic you have to improv your health becaus you know like differ sick can come from eat fast food or be obes or someth like that
313 c: okay so i hear a coupl thing that you'r say and one is that it sound like your major focus is to make choic from the healthier side of the menu when you go to a fast food restaur and i alreadi heard you articul someth here and that is
112 t: to improv health laugh yeah
308 c: yep so if you would like to write those down i mean it i think that sound like a fantast and doabl plan
120 t: what do you mean by if this get in the way ?
344 c: well this would be kind of the the plan ahead part where you think about what are what are thing that could possibl stop you from make this choic ?
112 t: mmm mayb your conscienc laugh mayb your conscienc could be one
332 c: describ for me a littl more about how that how you see that be someth that stop you from make the choic ?
112 t: mayb your focus could get in the way of that the focus of just stick to your plan
312 c: i got you so so like you see yourself sometim mayb you go into a restaur and you'r just not realli think about it so
309 c: you might forget to yeah great suggest
120 t: so i put focus on here ?
332 c: can you think of anyth els that sometim like if you pictur yourself in a fast food restaur what usual go on when you order a bigger meal or a higher calori meal ?
120 t: what usual go on ? can you give me an exampl ?
302 c: sure i sure can so some peopl find that when they go into a fast food restaur and they'r realli hungri they'r go to order more and they might eat more than they would if they had plan ahead so that might be one exampl of be extra hungri and not plan ahead some peopl find that if they'r with certain peopl they order differ thing and those might be healthier or unhealthi choic
120 t: so can we put environ on there ?
305 c: this is your plan so whatev you feel like the word if the word environment or environ if that a word that will cue you think okay i know that when the environ is this way i'm more like to make an unhealthi choic
109 t: well i i would rather put surround then surround becaus if i if i was to look at this and see environ i would probabl think of outsid or someth laugh
327 c: mm-hmm yeah a lot of peopl think that with that word
117 t: mm-hmm
308 c: yeah you make a veri good point about put it in your own word so
109 t: what els ? i could say mayb my friend caus like you said around certain peopl you might order differ thing
301 c: right right and other thing might occur to you over time too like now that this is on your mind and you have a plan for what you want to do you might discov thing that you hadn't realli notic befor you know as you'r pay more attent to what you'r do in a fast food restaur so unless you have other particular barrier that you want to list on there we can think of some thing that you can do to prevent these from stop you laugh
106 t: right yeah i think all of it is just basic keep the plan in mind that you keep in your focus basic in a good mindset that you have a plan and that you'r you have a goal basic
333 c: and how would you remind yourself of that so that you can keep it in mind ?
106 t: i think i'm go to have it somewher written down laugh to actual rememb like okay you know or just have self control i think that would be one
311 c: okay so you mention just have it written down is anoth thing do you have
112 t: 33:01 a remind
309 c: yeah yeah good think
303 c: where do you think you might put a remind that would be most like to be effect ?
106 t: in my phone in my cell phone yep becaus you know it when my phone ring i'm just like where is it ? so i think my phone would be i'll just put phone
330 c: okay
120 t: what els ?
301 c: and then a coupl thing relat to like the the thought that you have and the remind like the physic remind that you want to come up with and you know as i'm look at your list right here i'm see you know someth that could be realli use to you if you feel comfort
120 t: my friend ?
311 c: yeah your friend
305 c: laugh if you feel comfort share with them what you'r tri to work on and ask them for help
112 t: yeah i guess 0:34:03 i'll put famili too i think that all that can come to me right now
308 c: okay fair enough you'v got quit a quit a good list it look like
305 c: you know you'v touch on sever differ area so what about today ? when you leav here today it not go to be veri long
106 t: right so my first step could be is to keep this in mind when i'm go to get someth to eat caus i know i'm go to go get someth to eat when i leav becaus mom said she was hungri earlier so i guess just keep my plan in mind will be my first step
331 c: okay and who would you ask for help with reach your goal on this plan ?
106 t: i think i would ask my- right now today i think my mom would be who i would ask becaus she is go to be the one buy food laugh
308 c: that make sens that make sens yep that an excel insight is that you'r not alway in charg
112 t: just to help just basic help me stay focus on what i'm tri to do encourag me
308 c: okay those are realli great word to help you stay focus and encourag you
331 c: are there particular way or word that you need to hear from her that would be encourag for you ?
