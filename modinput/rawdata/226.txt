328 c: okay so you'v notic a lot of time that you spend is you know tv and comput time
117 t: mm-hmm
309 c: and the comput okay alright
328 c: well in the time that we have left i just want to know like you know you'v come up with some realli great idea in term of of this fact that you know you think get more activ on a regular basi right now would help you lose weight and you also have brought up some thing with the food where you know you have time where you you enjoy differ littl
117 t: mm-hmm
333 c: and i don't know you know what would you like to focus on ? you know kind of like come up with an idea mayb to work on when you leav here if you just had to kind of like pick someth small to realli focus on ?
112 t: probabl cut down on the eat like snack probabl becaus i snack a lot i think it becaus you get bore and then you get the munchi and then i think that whi i'm exercis more becaus like i don't mind exercis i actual like exercis but it like hard to find stuff to do dure summertim except for ride your bike and play with friend which i don't do becaus i don't have friend around the hous so
326 c: mm-hmm so you'r kind of you'r stuck right now in the fact that you'r home and you get bore at home becaus your friend aren't there
117 t: yeah
328 c: and it realli and so then you kind of munch a littl bit and so that one you know big thing you think you can work on right now
301 c: and would write down some of this be help to you or just kind of talk about it ?
112 t: i think talk is better becaus write down it doesn't realli work for me becaus i don't realli get it i think i don't get it it
305 c: yeah fair enough thank for let me know what best for you becaus that what go to do the most you know help for you this isn't about me laugh
331 c: alright so realli kind of think about the whole idea of the munchi if you had to have just a littl bit of a a plan with what you were go to do with that what would that be ?
112 t: probabl like snack onli twice a day between each meal becaus usual i just like snack just all day so i think that what i could do to like
311 c: alright so realli kind of give yourself like a this is my between breakfast and lunch snack
117 t: yeah
331 c: and have like your you know that this is when i'm go to have a snack and then i'm done alright well what is the the most import reason that you'd want to do that ?
112 t: to get healthier so that i won't be unhealthi and then i can be good for my senior year
311 c: okay so you'r realli think about senior year mayb some prom
117 t: laugh
324 c: dress and you want to be healthi and you know i notic a littl bit when you said so you don't want to be unhealthi that you were a littl unsur like you were kind of mayb just say
115 t: yeah becaus i don't want i don't want to be like i can't explain it like i don't want to be the one that say like "oh let go get ice cream" ! instead of say "like let stay home and just like go for a bike ride or something" i mean i want to be healthi but at the same time i want to be unhealthi sometim
311 c: so realli mix it in not say like i'm never go to have ice cream again
109 t: yeah i don't yeah i can't do that
305 c: that not for you and and
117 t: yeah
302 c: you know if i can kind of share with you that actual you know a healthier for some peopl a healthier approach so that they don't go to that crazi i'm go to eat the whole gallon of ice cream extrem
117 t: yeah
308 c: as oppos to just have a littl bit get a tast and then go you know have other healthi thing too yeah
313 c: so again you'r kind of bring your smart up here the way you'r approach your weight loss i like that so you realli have this idea that you'r look forward to senior year you want to be healthi and cut back on the snack
117 t: yeah
344 c: and keep that one do that what are some thing that could get in the way ?
109 t: if my sister move back in and bring her snack with her
312 c: okay becaus they'll just be around littl remind
117 t: yeah
344 c: and what els ?
109 t: hmm probabl i don't know what could be mayb if i like tri to eat too much and then i get right back on the same track and i think that what happen last time becaus i went to a nutritionist but she had me on rice cake and stuff she said "oh you should eat these" and i 
312 c: it wasn't fun to have somebodi tell you what to eat at all
109 t: yeah i don't like do that
305 c: so you feel a littl bit more in control now becaus you'r the one who decid what you'r go to have for snack
112 t: i think that me like i like be in control of me like i don't like anybodi els say like you have to eat this and you can't eat that"
311 c: mm-hmm yeah you don't like to be told what to do
112 t: yeah on some occas
305 c: laugh alright so you know kind of think this you know like your plan now is come a lot from you it make it a littl bit
112 t: easier
312 c: easier and better to stick to okay so you'v kind of come up with this idea that if your sister move back in that might get in the way of your snack
112 t: unless my mom has a good talk with her of hide her snack from me
311 c: oh so one of the thing you can do is kind of have your mom talk to your sister becaus her move back in is a pretti good chanc so she go to have to do that
120 t: yeah that might happen
311 c: alright so you'r realli think ahead talk to your mom be the one thing
333 c: you know what els could you do ?
112 t: i think i want to get the whole famili involv though becaus it it better to like work out with everybodi so you'll have moral support than just tri to do it all by yourself
311 c: alright so get them involv would be more help too
112 t: yeah becaus i think if it benefit me they'll probabl do it
308 c: good you'v got a good good famili you'r a good member of the famili and so they want to be good to you too
333 c: alright well i mean what the first thing that you could do in order to to reach your goal of you know cut back to mayb two snack a day ?
106 t: go groceri shop
