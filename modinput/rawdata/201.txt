119 t: so basic what you'r say is that i drink a liter within a week i gain a pound
302 c: if you drink yeah close if you drink four cup a day so not over a week becaus that wouldn't be that much right but four cup everi day of these drink and a cup is right like this mayb you know so most peopl drink like this right ? but if you drink four of these a day that about a pound yeah you got it and so that also mean the opposit right that if you cut out four cup a day that would be that would also be a pound tri to think if i have a pictur of a cup a cup is about a basebal or a tenni ball so it sometim smaller than peopl think
306 c: so what do you think of that ?

307 c: it can be kind of frustrat to keep have all these choic laugh and still not enough
117 t: i don't know
325 c: well what you'r not sure realli then what to substitut becaus if you can't drink sport drink or cola or fast food beverag and now you'r even hear that even fruit juic if you drink a lot of it it still has calori

117 t: that about it
302 c: okay i mean some kid say thing like energi or look differ or other health benefit
305 c: but it sound like for you mayb it just the diabet is your main worri
308 c: you alreadi have some realli good idea about what you want to do
328 c: you want to look at mayb not kind of starv yourself for a coupl day at a time and then go crazi and mayb tri to eat more regular meal and you also want to look at cut out calori drink
