305 c: t: i don't like i don't like to go-becaus sometim my mom she has a herniat disc in her back and some morn she just can't get up and walk around walk around the track and play mayb play basketbal but i wish it was some way she could do it but i understand if she can't like it some day that her back do sincer be hurt but other she might just not want to get up
109 t: c: so you it sound like you'd like to go to the track and play basketbal
311 c: and you'd like your mom to come with you but you'r not sure if she can
117 t: yeah
331 c: okay and tell me more about you want to do that
112 t: well i do not like walk around the track sometim so what i did was i took my psp and i notic that if you just like play and then you just start walk and you realli don't think about it like i just think about the
348 c: you can walk and play at the same time ?
112 t: yeah you can walk and play at the same time so i be sit walk there and then after a while you realiz that you might have walk around like three time
311 c: right it kind of like the way peopl like watch tv while they'r on the exercis bike or whatev that same concept
112 t: yeah like sometim i'm not like mayb she-lik sometim she do want to get up and go to the track but i might be tire we just gotta realli figur out someth where we like mayb make a list like what day we can get up and walk around the track
311 c: okay so one chang you'd like to make is a more kind of structur plan to get to the track
331 c: and with her are you allowed-i'm wonder what is it like to go without her ? is that an option or not an option ?
106 t: like she veri protect of me and it kind of like sometim i like-sh won't even let me-m and her be in the car me and her and my daddi be in the car and it might be get dark and we pull up to the gas station my dad be like "go ahead and get us pop out of there"-and my mom just like "no no you go in and get it" like she kind of protect of me and i understand whi though becaus i'm her only-lik i'm basic her onli child my sister 24 live in taylor but i i wouldn't mind becaus like my friend like i have one friend he not that big he like 140 i think and he get up and me him and his brother we have like a littl lawn mow servic where we go walk about four or five block and see if anybodi want their lawn mow and we tri to do that start with that
310 c: so you-so one of the reason she may not be thrill about you go alon is becaus she tend to be pretti protect and yet with this lawn servic you'r get a littl bit more freedom so mayb you could talk about it with her and kind of see where it at
109 t: becaus inaud like even if we like if we have a nice big yard that we have to cut and it about 6:30 i can't do it i have to go home becaus she like you have to get home by 6 7 o'clock and i'm like okay but like most peopl that when they'll let us cut the grass and that like i'm not get get ani money and plus i'm not get that much exercis so i have to go home
328 c: okay so there two area that you would like to be more activ in one is the track in the morn and the other is be abl to cut lawn a littl bit later in the even
305 c: which of these or both of them do you want to bring up potenti you know with her ?
112 t: i would say jog but lawn mow caus the thing is like we don't like lawn mow in the sun like 3:00
312 c: bake on you
109 t: we will do it but we don't like we like to-and that when i don't realli go out becaus like the sun at when i'm sweat it make my skin dri up and get realli dirti and everyth it like hard to get off my face but i will do it it just sometim my mom either if if it not me say i don't want to go outsid it too hot the heat like crazi outsid it either like she doesn't want me to go outsid
310 c: okay so do the lawn mow in the afternoon isn't a great option and so you could talk to her about go a littl bit later but mayb befor dark but later or someth like that
117 t: yeah
328 c: okay so i'm wonder you know one of the things-you'v come up with a coupl of those i mean obvious you'r do some thing like the breakfast and stuff that you'd like to continu do but the specif goal that it sound like you want to add today is make a plan for track in the morn and you can bring up the lawn mow thing also but the track in the morn is someth that realli you know that you want to do
302 c: and so some peopl find it help to write it down on a piec of paper their goal and other kid don't think that necessari
305 c: what would you like to do ?
117 t: uh
302 c: this is just like what your plan is what you want to do what might get in the way and kind of figur that out
112 t: i'm not sure laugh i think i can do that
348 c: the form ?
117 t: mm-hmm
305 c: okay so we can do it togeth if you want okay so your plan is to ?
106 t: to get outsid more and jog
313 c: okay so go to the track in the morn
328 c: now you'v said two differ thing you'v said walk with the psp and you said jog
302 c: are those-i'm not sure if jog with the psp is an option laugh
106 t: oh yeah it like if-se when you have a psp basic all you do is look at the screen and walk so and i walk around the track and i'm like basic i'm not focus on my walk i'm focus on my psp
311 c: and you can jog too it the same thing okay
106 t: i have to walk
313 c: okay so your plan is to go to the track in the morn
331 c: and whi do you want to do this ?
112 t: to get healthier and lose some weight
311 c: okay all right you realli want to increas the morn activ to get healthi
308 c: and continu the great stuff that you'v alreadi been do
344 c: and what might get in the way ?
109 t: my mom herniat disc
326 c: okay your mom not want to-eith want to get go or realli not be abl to get go
120 t: i don't realli know how to spell herniat disc
327 c: don't worri mayb someth
120 t: i'll just put back problem
329 c: okay laugh i'm not sure i could help you with the spell
333 c: and what could you tri to kind of get over that obstacl
106 t: jog with a friend
308 c: okay that a great idea have a friend to go with you so that she wouldn't be as nervous about you go by yourself
112 t: becaus my best friend they like my friend i'm not realli an earli person-wel i can get up earli and that when they go lawn go to start mow lawn becaus they have a few we have a few regular
346 c: so would you-i it realist that you could find someon to go with you in the morn ?
112 t: yeah i could jog with one of them becaus like my friend malik and brandon he like we and malik we don't realli go in the morn becaus we be asleep i think malik will get up and go walk around the track
310 c: okay so if you made a plan you know realli plan it out that someth that you think he could do and you'd have to kind of give him a call like mayb that day or someth and it would work for you
305 c: okay and what the first thing you can do to reach this goal you know like when you'r leav here today what could you do ? assum that your mom onboard
112 t: i could make a list that like would help me-lik i think that if my mom took her pain pill mayb at night it would help her where she doesn't feel that much pain in the morn and she might be abl to get up in the morn and jog
328 c: okay so mayb remind your mom about the pain pill she might be more like to in the morn and that someth you could do now and you also mention give your friend a call you know mayb the night befor and make a plan and that someth that you could do today if you want
