117 t: yeah
332 c: you know tell me a littl bit more about what goe on when you mean with the instinct
103 t: like say if you put water flavor water and then pop on a tabl and you say "choos one" my instinct will tell me to go for the pop but what i'm think want to go to either the flavor water or the water and my instinct most of the time take over and i grab the pop so or like if you put veget fruit and fri food my instinct may tell me go for the veget but i'm look at the fri food like okay littl bit tastier or healthier and i tri my best to go for the fruit caus actual i like fruit but when i see food that i know i like it kind of hard to keep it on the fruit
307 c: so again not onli are you come in here to talk to me have had some experi with work on your weight you'r realli think about you know that idea of sometim when you'r in the moment you know it tough you know what it feel like to have to make a choic about the food
117 t: yeah
313 c: and you'r realli work on how to make those choic healthier more often than not
117 t: yeah
308 c: wow that some serious thought about the weight
117 t: yeah
311 c: so you know it sound pretti import that you do want to take some weight off and you know make healthier choic
117 t: yeah
313 c: so you'r do a lot with think about the food
331 c: and when you are you know like say you have the water or you have the pop in front of you what would be some of the good thing to choos the pop i'm sorri to choos the water instead of the pop ?
311 c: okay alright so you'r realli are pretti awar of the reason that water healthier
308 c: i mean you know you'r a smart guy and peopl have been talk to you a lot about your health
117 t: yeah
314 c: you'r hear the stuff but you'r still choos the pop
117 t: yeah
305 c: well you know when you came in here i kind of mention that you have the chanc to say what you'd like to talk about more and i get the feel that for you you kind of said pop is one thing that you'r work on choos less but you'r not realli sure if you want to do it more often or not
103 t: well if i can't cut down on the pop like caus my mom cook more healthier stuff but then it the thing of me over it still and that what basic happen like my mom cook healthi i'm still tri to drink the pop but then i overeat on the healthi food then i realli don't like realli count whether it healthi or not caus inaud
328 c: so you'r kind of catch yourself with the portion too you'r choos healthi food your mom you know cook them for you she cook healthier
117 t: yeah
308 c: hmm so you again have you know you have a lot of idea and actual you know quit a bit i mean it not like i need to sit here and kind of say to you "well let have a nutrit class and this is what peopl need to do to lose weight" you know a lot about that stuff
117 t: yeah yeah
331 c: so when you think about kind of choos you know you talk about some of the thing that your instinct have you choos the pop instead of like the water even though you know you have a lot of realli good reason for drink water the pop is tast better
112 t: when basic one doctor alreadi told me that all the weight just make my ill worser and have more inaud to open my bodi and put stress on differ part of my bodi and stuff
307 c: so it realli come back to your health and how scari it is to think about what go on right now in your bodi ?
117 t: yeah yeah
331 c: so what would it take for you to say "okay you know i'm go to choos water instead of pop" ?
117 t: i don't know

311 c: so it kind of someth that alway bug you ?
117 t: yeah
307 c: and make the decis to realli do someth about it like chang what you'r drink or eat smaller portion like you talk about is a tough thing to do
117 t: yeah
331 c: well on a scale of one to ten where one would be like not at all import and ten would be veri import how import would you say it is for you to make a chang in either your portion or what you'r drink ?
112 t: i would give it like a five or a six
311 c: so it in the import rang ?
117 t: yeah
331 c: alright so what made you say a five or a six instead of like a three or a four ?
111 t: becaus i think i pretti much want to go for the chang but it go to take someth to get me up to a ten that make me want to chang fulli
311 c: okay so someth is go to you know you'v got some reason in there but you realli have like this what is go to be to get you higher ?
117 t: yeah
331 c: well tell me what would it take to get you up to a littl bit higher not necessarili a ten even though that a great place to go if you want to but what would it take to bump you up to mayb like a seven or an eight in how import it is for you to chang your eat and drink ?
112 t: probabl probabl for someth someth that realli bad happen deal with bad food and pop and stuff it'd have to be someth realli bad to happen like somebodi in my famili die from it or some someth has to happen i just don't know yet
