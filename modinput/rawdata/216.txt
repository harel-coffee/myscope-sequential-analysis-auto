117 t: yeah
307 c: and it get on your nerv laugh yeah all right
311 c: so those other peopl realli are say enough that it bother you that you do want to do some thing
301 c: we have a chanc to talk about either nutrit stuff or thing relat to physic activ or we can talk about both
305 c: what would you like to realli focus on in our time togeth ?
112 t: nutrit
311 c: the food side of thing ? all right
305 c: so when you think about nutrit and lose weight what idea do you have on thing that might work for you ?
114 t: inaud caus like i live with my grandma and i'v live with my mom and my grandmoth you know she was a salad rabbit type eater you know and i ate-sh ate you know it was just like that and then i'v live with my mom and who not a rabbit type eater laugh you know so and like i didn't realli see the differ you know like i just stay the same and that kind of hurt me too so
325 c: so you have kind of live with peopl that have had veri differ eat style and you'v done the same thing and it hasn't made a differ in your weight which made you think like what the heck is go on ?
305 c: all right so the salad the rabbit type of eat versus not you had no problem do either but again when you'r talk about weight loss you didn't see anyth so you'r kind of wonder what is it go to take like what the stuff that i need to do to make thing go well tell me a littl bit more about your idea you know base on where you'r live right now
120 t: what do you mean ?
329 c: i gotta i gotta make more better question huh
327 c: so you kind of have some-you'v been do differ thing in term of eat differ style
302 c: and while i have some inform that peopl might you know we could go over if you'd like some peopl might like to talk about it in here as far as like way that peopl can look at cut calori and eat healthi
305 c: what idea do you have about what you could do right now to cut those thing down ?
114 t: i'll eat and then lay down you know like that or i'll get on the comput or someth like that and i know i need to like i guess do someth activ or whatev so i guess i have to chang that and i don't eat like on time you know i don't eat breakfast my lunch are like when i get home from school it like four i eat dinner around like ten go to bed around like two so i know it not healthi to do that either i don't know i eat when i'm bore i know that
308 c: so alreadi you'r realli awar of a lot of thing that you'r do around eat and activ if you'r mention stuff about lay down and be on the comput that honest a lot of other peopl don't realli catch on to
311 c: so you'r kind of come up with the idea that a littl bit of inact is one thing that you could possibl work on anoth one be more work on like regular meal and then the watch like the snack or the eat when you'r bore
305 c: so if you realli had to pick one to focus on
302 c: one small thing at a time
117 t: yeah
327 c: someth you'v heard of befor ? laugh
305 c: you know what if ani of those would you like to focus on ?
113 t: eat when i'm bore that a big problem that my biggest one i think
311 c: all right so find thing to do when you'r bore other than eat
117 t: yeah
333 c: so what type of thing could you do instead of eat ?
114 t: i don't know like i don't mind go place or be out you know or walk or whatev i don't mind exercis i just don't like to do it by myself so like i don't realli have anybodi i don't like-mi mama is comfort the way she is you know sinc she doesn't want to chang so that out my best friend you know he live all the way on the other side of town where i use to live and i'm not where i live i tend to-it an apart complex and it like a lot of hous but not a veri talkat person you know i don't realli know anybodi like that so i don't know
310 c: so you alreadi kind of know yourself realli well in say that if you had somebodi to do someth with you wouldn't feel as bore
119 t: yeah he came over like not yesterday but the day befor yesterday or whatev and start out the whole day just walk around apart but he wasn't there i wouldn't have did that i would have been in the hous on the comput or someth like that
310 c: so you'r a lot more activ when you have peopl to be around with as well
312 c: you'r less like to do the wait but right now you know it sound like you'v kind of move recent and you don't know a lot of other peopl around there and your mom isn't realli somebodi that want to be out and about be activ this is someth you'v talk about with her befor
109 t: it just like i live with my grandma for like two year and that was one of the major thing or whatev was that she kept tri to chang me like how i weigh or whatev and it wasn't so much i didn't want to chang just the way she was go about it was not right or whatev and my mom and my grandma got into an argument about it and it was just like i guess a constant thing that my mom didn't want to chang or anyth like she kind of relat to me and told me and stuff so it never like never came out ask her like but it just a question i know the answer to yeah
312 c: so you kind of move back home move back in with your mom becaus your grandma was realli pretti bothersom about your weight and you don't know about talk to your mom about it you know the answer and you also don't want to caus that kind of conflict that happen with your mom and your grandma
117 t: yeah
305 c: how would you feel if you did talk to her about you know be more activ or do thing togeth in the time that we have here today ?
108 t: i would rather didn't you know like i don't see where that would fit in that she like i have somewher to go from ten to two thirti she drop me off in the morn then my brother has swim practic and she drop him off then she has five kid and not a big enough truck becaus she goe to work on her other truck and my two youngest brother don't live there so she goe to see them and i don't see how that would fit in
328 c: so you realli have kind of assess the situat and your mom not realli the best person to talk to about that and your friend your best friend live across town so you don't get to see him veri frequent
120 t: i mean we see each other but like  i don't believ we'v ever gone a week without see each other whatev but it just when we do it it plan out or it not plan out you know like oh i seen him at the mall you know yeah so
310 c: so you'r look for someth to do that more regular becaus you know that the eat when you'r bore is someth that happen everi day and you'd like somebodi that there a littl bit more frequent to do thing with all right
120 t: i want a dog but we live in an apart can't get dog there
307 c: that kind of tough when laugh where you live doesn't let you do those kind of thing all right
328 c: so find that person to you know kind of hang out with and to be more activ with and to cut down on the eat when you'r bore sound like the thing that you'r realli look for right now and you'r have troubl come up with who that person could be and you mention peopl around the complex but you don't realli know then veri well and your mom out and other member of the famili might not fit with what you'r look for either
117 t: yeah
333 c: so if this person is kind of realli that import part of you you know make some chang with your activ and the eat when you'r bore how do we find that person ?
115 t: well i don't i don't believ it necessarili have to be-i don't know i don't want to say it doesn't have to be a person but  i don't know if i just i got someth to do you know just just to do like  i don't know
310 c: so if you kind of had your thing doesn't have to be that you'r wait for somebodi els to be like okay i'm here to do-it more if you had a schedul you had someth plan
112 t: yeah i like a schedul
311 c: all right so have that structur someth you like it work well for you
112 t: yeah i discov that when i went to the hospit so yeah i like the  i don't know it just not necessarili the peopl tell me what to do but just know i guess
311 c: all right so you in the past when it happen you realli like the fact that there was again the structur this is what happen today this is what go to be go on
117 t: yeah
305 c: so how would you go about put someth like that in what you'r do now if you want to in term of like you know an activ or eat the structur ?
114 t: um becaus like a lot of stuff happen like off plan you know like my mom cook on monday you know so it like everi other day besid that either she bring home someth to eat or it like get a hot pocket you know or whatev it is and i mean i can cook that what i want to go to colleg for so it like it doesn't realli matter but i was go to say-oh like i don't know like sometim she come home inaud cook or whatev so i don't want to start cook and then she'll be like "i was go to cook" or i don't want to cook for my brother or whatev and she bring home someth and 
325 c: so it the-it kind of like this unknown what go to be happen for meal
308 c: and you are realli you know kind in the fact that you don't want to start someth and then kind of upset what your mom had in mind for the schedul and do that  ?
305 c: well if you you know had a chanc to talk to your mom about some stuff sinc we do have some time togeth today when we'r done with the session what would you kind of want to share with her about get in the structur ?
101 t: no
305 c: this isn't someth you want to talk to her about this is someth that you realli want to do on your own
312 c: so structur the meal sinc it realli family-bas is too difficult to do
305 c: and it realli has to be someth that kind of come from you work on without have to have your mom chang her schedul or thing like that
117 t: yeah
309 c: okay and it tells-i mean you'v realli been you know the way that you'r kind of share this stuff with me you'r realli think through option like you'r come up with idea
325 c: and your not quit sure if theyr go to be work or not
311 c: but the one that you come back to is that idea that you realli did like when you were in the hospit that idea of structur there was some kind of a schedul and it work realli well for you</tex
117 t: yeah
333 c: and it won't really-you can't realli get structur in term of the day or i'm sorri like the meal and anyth what could you structur in your day ?
116 t: i guess what i do instead of be on the comput and you know just set a time limit or whatev becaus like there stuff i like to do but  i don't know
311 c: so there stuff that you like to do
331 c: and you'r think about give yourself like this time window to do it tell me a littl bit more about that
112 t: i mean not necessarili there a time limit but i was just think of the fact how long i be on the comput or watch tv or whatev i want to take a class over the summer it was a cake decor class or whatev want to do that there in k-mart and there was some think it was like make a purs or someth like that and i like to do littl stuff like that but  i don't know just
325 c: so you'r find stuff that look like fun fun class to go out new peopl learn new thing that are thing that you might learn when you go to school you know your career in the culinari world and there someth stop you from be abl to do them right now
109 t: my grandma main she realli weird i don't know she think a lot of thing are pointless you know so
312 c: so she doesn't realli see the point to it
307 c: and that realli tough becaus everi time you find someth get excit about it she there to say no
329 c: but those type of things-sorri if i bump you
328 c: those type of thing are realli stop you from kind of get out of the hous and do less of the tv and the comput stuff and you see that that one way that you can realli work on stop the eat when you'r bore now you mention that your grandma realli has kind of been tough on you about your weight
119 t: yeah and the thing that make me mad is like becaus she a depress too or whatev and it realli irrit me like that this year or yeah this year-last school year the begin of the school year i want to go to homecom or whatev and she sold these-i guess they were call bodi magic suit or someth like that and they were suppos to make you lose some type of weight well not lose it but appear to lose it and i didn't want it but she told me i had to get it or whatev and we order my homecom dress offlin and she order it too small becaus the suit or whatev was suppos to i guess or whatev and then like when it got there she told me to tri it on my mom was stare at of cours you know i couldn't fit it she was like "well you need to lose some weight to fit into it" or someth like that and i got like realli mad and caus i felt like not so much as like i didn't want to lose the weight becaus that probabl would have been motiv you know like i realli want that dress or whatev but two day befor homecom you know that kind of like imposs and onli she wound up get me the thing and it did fit and everyth but it was just a point was
307 c: the way that it went about it what a tough thing to get your dress right befor the danc and to hear that
117 t: yeah
311 c: but for you it sound like have a littl bit of a kind of a goal in mind with a reason time frame for weight loss is someth that help to kind of keep you on track with thin
307 c: yeah i'm realli sorri that that happen with all the work to get and excit for the dress and stuff yeah
301 c: we don't have a ton of time left for our littl portion to talk today
308 c: and i want to say thank for share a lot of stuff with me in term of what go on and realli the great idea that you have
328 c: be awar of the fact that you'r eat when you'r bore
302 c: and that kind of a way that peopl can have extra calori throughout the day
328 c: and then this idea of watch how much time you'r inact you'v kind of suggest schedul thing and that
305 c: and i don't know if there anyth in particular that you realli want to focus on after leav here today
101 t: no
312 c: you can't realli think of anyth that jump out at you
310 c: so it might be more that it just you'r go to kind of think about you know what you could do to help with the weight loss
117 t: yeah
343 c: well if you had like a scale of one to ten where one would be not at all import ten would be veri import excus me how import is it for you to find someth to focus on in order to lose weight ?
113 t: a ten
311 c: so it on that veri import rang
331 c: what made you say a ten and not a lower number again eight or a nine ?
112 t: becaus i know i'm unhealthi and i don't like it
328 c: okay so it realli this idea that you'r readi for some chang to move forward all right and find that thing is kind of the tough part you know make the decis on what to do and what to stick through
308 c: yeah well i mean the idea that you alreadi have are realli smart you know solid idea and so you come in with a lot of realli great inform so all right it just a matter of you know realli mayb find the thing that is right for you
