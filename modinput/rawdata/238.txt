308 c: you'r realli dedic to keep yourself in shape and realli work on lose weight you know you'll keep run even when the rest of the class isn't do it
305 c: what what make you want to do that stuff ?
112 t: becaus it realli my goal to be faster so i can be a run back so it come footbal time i'm think i'm gonna be like a big man not a like a chunki man a big man fast
308 c: you realli are abl to keep your goal in mind all the time you know you'r alway go for that footbal for footbal alright
328 c: so activ dure the wintertim is one place that you kind of see you'r a littl concern about how you'r go to keep up with it and you know keep your cardiovascular shape and keep lose weight so that you'r readi for footbal alright you know so gym class is one
331 c: who are some peopl that could help you figur out about this goal ?
115 t: i can just tell my mother there ain't no becaus i don't talk that much becaus i'm realli shi to talk to my teacher or to peopl
308 c: oh you'r you'r serious about this and that whi you'r actual come in here and talk to me even though it not realli someth you like to talk to peopl about veri much
329 c: i realli appreci that you'r be so open and you know i can tell you'r here to to you know get your goal
306 c: you put the same kind of effort into footbal practic ?
309 c: that impress
312 c: so you said teacher so peopl like you know at school it not realli someth that you you talk to them about the goal of the weight loss what about you know other peopl in your life ? it not someth you want to talk about with your famili like with your brother or with your mom or anyth ?
306 c: whi is that ?
109 t: noth i mean i'm nervous now becaus when i'm nervous i shake my leg just to calm me down becaus when i'm nervous i just keep on talk and talk like when you talk i wanna talk
312 c: it just kind of make a nois and kind of to fill in some thing
307 c: and so you know again we'r kind of go back to this whole idea that you you want to be realli lose weight for footbal so much so that you'll come in here and talk to me about someth that realli hard for you to do
305 c: yeah you'r that dedic to it that say a lot about you know your person and and how much you'r will to realli put yourself out there to to get that goal yeah
307 c: but you know at the same time it it difficult to talk about it
305 c: well what would make it you know what would be help from me ?
119 t: do you all have like some kind of gym in here that you could work out and stuff ?
311 c: so if we had resourc that you could come here dure the wintertim and kind of keep up with your workout
302 c: not in this build necessarili but if you'd like i might be abl to look up some resourc and mayb give you a list of place that you could check out for how to stay activ
310 c: and you know i wonder if talk to your mom about find place to be activ you know do exercis dure the wintertim might be a way to get more idea and stay activ
304 c: but you did mention then you realli don't talk to your famili about weight or tell them about your goal and thing and so on the one hand you know you kind of don't realli want to talk to them about it and then on the other hand they they might be abl to to help a bit if they had differ idea
305 c: but you'r you know you need to kind of figur out what you want to do with that if anyth
117 t: yeah
307 c: it hard to think about talk about someth that you haven't talk to them about befor
311 c: so it seem realli that you'd like to -no that okay you'd like to stay work on this goal on your own and not necessarili bless you and not necessarili talk to other peopl about it or you'r think that that mayb you talk to some peopl in your famili about it
111 t: i might cough i might talk to my mom
328 c: so anoth idea that you kind of came up with is talk to your mom about it if you decid to so we talk a lot about activ and exercis and you'r do a lot of stuff there
307 c: take your time
328 c: lot of stuff go around you alright ? do you need more water ? alright so we'v talk a lot about exercis and realli you'r do a lot now two you know two hour a day and you mention some thing that you'r chang as far as eat
301 c: and a lot of time when i work with peopl sometim you know what they'll do is they'll kind of pick someth that they realli want to work on when they leav here
305 c: would that be someth that you'd want to talk about ?

302 c: sometim when i work with peopl some peopl like to pick one littl thing that they can do that small but they'r go to do it on a regular basi so they get realli you know good at it that way and they'll just kind of chip away at the weight and other time when i work with peopl they you know realli want to have like you know big goal or they want to you know lot of other thing
305 c: and you know i'm not realli sure where you fit in in all of that if you were to kind of want someth that was smaller and that you can just kind of do a littl bit at a time on a regular basi
345 c: you get better or you get wors ?
