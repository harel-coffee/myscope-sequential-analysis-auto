107 t: so i'm still walk from school and to school everi day
311 c: mm-hmm okay so it sound like realli you'r pretti motiv to do this
331 c: what are the reason that you want to get down to 175 ?
113 t: well becaus i know it a lot of peopl that overweight in my famili and for them be overweight it caus them to be diabet i have low sugar and high sugar and all that other stuff so i decid i didn't want to go through all the health problem although diabet and sugar problem run in the famili so it wouldn't have to do with you gain weight or lose weight or anyth caus it just run in the famili but i'd rather be on the safe side by me take precaut
311 c: right so you know that diabet run in the famili and there a certain part of it that genet but you also know that you might be abl to avoid some of the thing by take precaut and keep your weight down and it sound like your health is what motiv you right now you want to be healthi and strong
117 t: yeah

113 t: well i know i was in a nurs program and that kind of help me lose a lot of weight too becaus we do a lot of run around do a lot of thing and a nurs is what i want to be so i alreadi knew that my senior year which is go to be come up this year we go into hospit and actual work on real patient so we are onli run around hospit and with that you lose a lot of weight from that caus you gotta go up and down stair and take
311 c: so you need to keep your energi up to do these clinic and if you were at a lower weight you might be abl to run around you know it would be easier for you to run around and you have a profession goal which is import to you i'm hear which is the nurs
120 t: and if that doesn't go well i will be a polic offic so it still
327 c: you have a backup plan
117 t: yeah
311 c: and both of them requir you to be kind of physic fit both of these job okay well it sound like you'r a young woman with a lot of idea you know and plan for yourself and i'm hear a real sort of like this is what i'm go to do and this is my backup plan i'm go to do it yeah
120 t: i had to plan everyth out alreadi especi with this be my last year in school
328 c: so you'r think ahead yeah
305 c: so you know i'm hear that you alreadi made a fair amount of chang with fruit and veget and be activ and you want to keep this go so where are you at right now in term of how to kick it up a notch mayb or someth a new thing you might want to add either with diet or with nutrit or exercis i don't know if you have idea if you want to look at some idea
113 t: well i'm alway into new idea
302 c: okay well we can kind of go through some of these-i'm go to leav these with you some of these are just resourc and you know like idea that are in the communiti so i'll leav that with you and you know we can just kind of take a bird eye view and you can pick which one you might want to talk about

106 t: and stuff so i actual pay attent to them more than anyth i look at someth while i'm eat oh this got such and such calori
311 c: okay so you alreadi have learn about food label and you know how to-and that someth you got out of the program it sound like
113 t: yeah so i was do a lot of that
302 c: so okay so let see this talk about kind of increas your activ a littl bit more like three day a week for 60 minut of high intens or four day a week for sort of lower intens and strength so that one thing you could do is increas exercis
107 t: well the exercis that i do is like besid the walk my dog and walk to school my brother veri play so we do a lot of run around the hous play and wrestl and a lot of other thing
313 c: so you stay just activ kind of on a day to day basi

302 c: so in term of food we'v got stay away from sugari drink healthier choic around the fast food in restaur we can talk about look at portion size anoth thing peopl do is write down food
106 t: i did i had start it when i was in catch program i was also in weight watcher so weight watcher you have to write down what have you ate how much have you ate and i would alway take a big portion but now i won't and if i tri to my mom get on my head about it so i learn how to take smaller portion get smaller plate and i just eat what i have and wait for everybodi els to eat and if i still want to eat i go eat food afterward
313 c: so you keep a small portion of-lik your first pass is a small portion and then if you'r still hungri then you tri to go back for fruit and veget
117 t: yes
328 c: okay so you know i guess mayb you can tell me a littl more about in the catch program you lost 20 pound and since-and you have a goal of get down to 175

308 c: okay okay so it sound like mayb you realli don't need to do ani new thing becaus it sound like most of the stuff you'r alreadi do you mention record food and you know that often a good way to lose weight which you'v talk about
333 c: how are you do with record what your intak right now ?
