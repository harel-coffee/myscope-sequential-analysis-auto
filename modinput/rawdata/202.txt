311 c: so see other peopl eat thing like fast food all the time is pretti unhealthi =
112 t: and then have a salad and they get sick like 22:00 okay just go to stick with the veget
313 c: stick with the healthier choic here
117 t: yeah
311 c: so you have alreadi lot of fruit and veget in your diet
117 t: yeah
333 c: what other idea do you have about way that you could you know look at weight loss through eat chang ?
106 t: like i do snack like i have a lot of snack but like healthi snack like i eat a lot of fruit snack and stuff like that i don't know like i have a bag of chip everi onc in a while some candi but that about it
313 c: so you'r kind of more on the snack idea and you realli work to balanc it between eat thing that might tast better like chip and other thing that you know that tast good and are healthi for you like fruit and veget
110 t: like i know granola bar but they'r not realli that healthi laugh
302 c: you know we have a littl inform about type of food and figur out you know healthi thing would you be interest in hear about that kind of stuff ? well it interest becaus you mention stuff about the fruit snack and a lot of time those are actual not realli have a lot of fruit in them =
109 t: just sugar yeah
330 c: yeah they do just =
106 t: the kind that we eat i think is mott i don't know the kellogg one they'r just like-they all 23:28 is like the sugar but the mott one they'r actual made with appl juic and like i don't realli read the label on food but that i actual did read and like one day and it like it is made with like 100% juic like the appl and all that =
308 c: i'm impress that you'r do so much label read and you know right away to name off the brand and to tell me what they said that you know what you'r talk about so you'r realli pretti interest in weight manag becaus you'r realli notic thing and pay attent to what you'r do
112 t: well mayb read the mott box was like i was eat one day i was like "this tast like actual like the real fruit like i can actual tast the fruit in it" and like i read the box and it said it actual made of 100% juic and so they might caus they =
311 c: and it made a differ in the way it tast
111 t: yeah caus like most are someth like thick you can't like see through them like you can see through those i'm like "whi can you see through these" ? and it like becaus it made with like real juic and so 24:28 it neat caus they'r not that chewi and these tast differ than like most stuff and it like no ad sugar like all natur wow laugh
311 c: realli make a differ laugh
112 t: most thing that you eat healthi the healthier food doesn't tast that great but those are like if i could surviv off of those i would laugh they'r realli good
325 c: so you'r notic that you like the way thing that peopl call healthier food you like the way they tast more
117 t: yeah
343 c: tell me a littl more about that
104 t: i like like some stuff like the corn flake that suppos to be healthier like they don't have ani tast like sometim these thing have no tast and i like to add the sugar on becaus like 25:14 like i love grapefruit i can i realli do like one summer that pretti much all i ate like i just like to squish them and like laugh i 25:25 eat them someth like that sugar on them i think that like 25:28 with the healthi part like the vitamin or whatev
314 c: so you'r a littl bit concern becaus sometim you have to chang improv the flavor by ad thing like sugar to the food
104 t: yeah like becaus sometim it like if i eat too much grapefruit it flavor just like kind of goe away so i like some sugar to it
314 c: and you'r think that when you'r do that the extra calori come from the sugar make it not as healthi
109 t: and they say like it better to have splenda and i don't like splenda laugh i tast splenda it like ugh
312 c: it doesn't work for you
112 t: but they're-i don't rememb which place the bottl water flavor bottl water they use splenda and it like realli good
311 c: so you find some product that you like with the non-calor stuff and then =
112 t: yeah and you can tast the real fruit in this one 26:20 some better stuff
308 c: you realli are look around and actual experi a lot with tri differ thing and sometim a lot of peopl won't they'll kind of say like "ew i'm not even go to tri that"
106 t: yeah like we drink the-w don't have caffein we don't drink caffein my mama and like we'll have it onc in a while like if we have like mountain dew or someth but when we drink tea we drink caffein free tea like the herbal tea and it like it actual doe tast better than like the lipton stuff with the caffein in it so
313 c: so again you'r find like you did with the fruit snack =
106 t: yeah like the pop like we drink caffein free pepsi and actual like the way that one tast better than pepsi with caffein like you can tast 27:03 or someth and it better
302 c: you know the thing that you kind of said about the sugar make me just kind of wonder if you'v heard you know ani inform about this idea of portion size
114 t: yeah like i tri like-th onli thing i eat a lot of is mayb i can overdo it with some tomato i love tomato and like she has like make a big meal i probabl eat like one plate and that it like i tri for a while i did the portion thing just like it felt weird like everybodi go to get second and i'm just sit there like uh
313 c: so you realli held yourself at that point to not go back and have second and it was a littl tough but you were abl to do it
109 t: yeah especi when it was like realli realli good
309 c: oof wow
109 t: like her lasagna is the best thing ever laugh
308 c: so it was it was a tough-lik you did it with-you didn't do it with food you didn't like you did it with food you realli like
106 t: yeah like i tri it with everyth like when we go to like burger king mayb i'll get two junior whopper and fri get one junior whopper no fri like i tri to wear myself off of it
313 c: so kind of like gradual go down on the portion
333 c: so what go on with that now ?
106 t: like now like when i eat out-actu before-wel not now i'm happi with just go and mayb a pop or someth like i'm good with a medium pop now so i tri to-saw this movi last month on the mcdonald supers me so now it like go past mcdonadl 28:42 laugh i'm like =
311 c: it realli turn you off from it
106 t: yeah i eat everyth but mcdonald i can still go and get their parfait that about it
313 c: so make healthi you know choic at the fast food place
311 c: and you'r realli abl to stick with this portion you don't seem to be miss the food that you'r eat
116 t: yeah my mom had a book for like eat right with your blood type and i was read that and all the differ blood type i don't know my blood type so it like everybodi els in the hous eat right for their blood type i'm like okay i just read the book laugh i like don't know my blood type i think it the same as my dad so
325 c: so it fun to kind of read it but you can't quit do everyth it say until you find out what your blood type might be
313 c: you do a lot of this inform a lot of research on eat
117 t: yeah
305 c: so with all this inform that you gather and all this other stuff you put togeth in term of read the label and know about like the healthi natur food that you'r do and the portion size stuff you know what is it that you'd kind of like to realli work on in term of the nutrit stuff ?
106 t: mayb like be a littl more activ and main be activ and like the eat right kind of thing i kind of got like to me like eat veget oil instead of like the other like i don't know the other type of oil but 30:11 healthi may eat fri food onc a month and that like she use-lik we eat a lot of chicken like she'll tri it all differ way like fri it one month and then like the next week we'll have like bake or steam chicken and i don't eat that much pork anymor
328 c: so you'v alreadi made a lot of chang to the eat and you'r pretti happi with that and focus on activ might be the way to realli bump up your weight loss all right so we kind of go back to that idea of like find that thing that you might want to tri to do two time a week
302 c: a lot of time when i meet with peopl we kind of put togeth a littl bit of a plan
305 c: how doe that sound to you ?
117 t: okay
302 c: this kind of you know walk through what your plan you know might be
311 c: and again we talk about a lot of stuff today and it seem like you'r realli come back again to that idea of activ
305 c: so what would your plan for this activ what would it be ?
114 t: i'm not realli sure like maybe-i don't know laugh
325 c: so when you'r realli face with have to like write someth down it hard to come up with what what you actual want to do
114 t: yeah i actual like i have 31:41 and i'm like uh laugh
325 c: yeah caus it can be like right on the tip of your tongu
311 c: and you know we spent a littl bit of time talk about that idea of do someth a coupl time a week and tri to figur out what that might be
305 c: would that be someth that you'd like to kind of work on ? or should we tri for someth els ? i mean you don't have to write it down for me laugh
114 t: i know like i don't have anyth to do but it like how to do it and stuff like we my grandmoth she like makes-mi great-grandmother-sh make all the differ stuff she done 32:34 gravi and all this stuff on it she'll be like it your favorit but becaus it kind of hard to eat healthier around other it like my main thing how to eat around the other famili member and stuff
311 c: ah so onc you-'caus you kind of have to deal with outsid of be in your hous too
305 c: and then that might actual be someth you would rather focus on is talk through how to deal with other famili member and eat
120 t: mm-hmm like write that down ? laugh
305 c: well would you like to write it down ?
101 t: no laugh
305 c: not realli ? you'd just prefer to kind of talk it out a littl bit more ?
117 t: yeah
333 c: okay so this idea of what to do when you'r eat at other peopl hous and they make food that aren't quit so healthi how do you get around that ?
106 t: it like you get like she make 33:35 like a small piec and like not that much gravi or whatev like then i have like a big cup of water someth i feel like fill up on that laugh
313 c: so you'r alreadi do thing like have the smaller portion
325 c: but still there someth there that isn't sit quit right with you
103 t: no it like my aunt she make like a realli good macaroni she use all these differ chees and it like that like unhealthi just too much for me but i still eat it it like a lot
311 c: so figur out a way to talk to your famili about those type of food around you might be help to kind of reach your weight loss goal
331 c: okay and is this like who somebodi in your life that could kind of help you talk to those peopl ?
116 t: i don't know laugh like me-i don't know becaus it like they do for like my grandma she know like we don't eat the caffein so like she'll-lik if we spend like-last summer i spent a coupl week at her hous so it like she just stock up on like kool-aid and like fruit juic like and refresh and caus we don't like-'caus she like support it and like the healthier food she like just eat laugh so it like and like my great-grandma like she doesn't eat that much anymor becaus sinc her-sh had surgeri so it like she eat less and less now so like everybodi kind of tri it but it like so everi onc in a while like dure the barbecu and whatev like everyth drown in barbecu sauc or someth
311 c: so a lot of peopl in your famili are make some small chang to be healthi
109 t: but it still a lot
326 c: but there still more that they can do or that you'r tri to do and it hard to do when there other food around that are realli realli good
333 c: so if you do go to a barbecu and all those food are around you know what are some thing that you could do ?
106 t: like we went to a barbecu last week and then had the rib and hamburg and hot dog and i just had a grill chicken caus they had grill a chicken and i had that and potato salad and that was like it so i guess it sound healthier but i don't 
313 c: so you again are kind of make chang on your own

116 t: yeah it was okay becaus i had the peach cobbler and like i kept go back for slushi i love slushi but it like i mean becaus i kind of think slushi are healthi becaus i mean like ice but i also feel like all those artifici color and sugar in it so
325 c: so again you'r kind of get back to like well some part of the food is healthi and some part you'r not quit sure about like with the grapefruit ad the sugar and thing
117 t: yeah
302 c: you know i have some inform about beverag if you'd be interest like you know how to-what you'r drink and energi and that

305 c: well this littl inform here-and again as we'r go through it just be like "kati this is boring" if you need to okay ?
302 c: so this is actual talk about what are you drink and it talk about this idea that a lot of time sport drink energi drink anyth that like a fruit drink or flavor ice tea and a lot of soft drink realli have littl or no nutrit valu and drink a liter or more of these a day could actual look like in a week about one pound a week

326 c: yeah it kind of goe back to that what you were say when you know there are thing that you know but actual put them into action can be realli tough
314 c: so this is not someth that new to you in term of you know have a lot of calori in what you'r drink and it doesn't realli make you feel veri full
