312 c: is it in your sleep time ?
109 t: yeah but but i guess just the food is still in my stomach or whatev and i guess that keep my weight up becaus that the onli thing i can realli say is do that i don't know what els
312 c: so i guess what i hear you say is there is a certain part of the day when becaus of your sleep apnea and mayb some other factor but you'r not sure that you have a sleepier time and you'r wonder if mayb that not give your food a chanc to digest
117 t: i guess yes
305 c: okay well you know how interest are you in work out mayb a plan to chang that for ya ?
112 t: i'm veri interest in it
311 c: okay so it sound like you'r kind of readi like i don't need to convinc you laugh
117 t: yeah
305 c: okay alrighti so i guess you know if you were go to walk out of here today with someth in mind that you will chang for this part of the day what do you think would give you the most benefit if you were to think ?
112 t: just to live a long life becaus somebodi liter younger than me die caus of their weight
307 c: wow yeah
112 t: and so and he was onli 15 so
311 c: so you have some motiv that are you know kind of health and kind of down the road thing could happen
112 t: yeah i would have to have me die from anyth
326 c: mm-hmm so you know you mention this part of the afternoon when or the even when it kind of difficult for you to be activ dure that time
305 c: if we were mayb to think about someth that you might like to do whether it at this part of the day or a differ part of the day
302 c: a lot of peopl do the thing that you mention they chang what they eat or how they eat they chang their activ level in some way to help with weight loss
305 c: so if you were gonna make a chang which one of those would you think would be the most benefici to you right now ?
120 t: like as in ?
301 c: well if you and i were to think of like say an exercis plan or like mayb a plan to i don't know how much tv you watch but mayb a plan to watch less tv some peopl that i'v met with like to make a plan to chang the type of food they eat or the way that it cook for exampl or they like to keep track of what they eat so that they realli have a good sens of you know whether when they say i don't think i overeat that they actual know
117 t: okay
305 c: so do ani of those idea sound appeal to you or ?
111 t: i guess the less tv and i bare even do that i know it not the food caus like becaus of me we'r all do it so i just help everybodi els too out at the same time so it not
309 c: yeah that a good idea
117 t: that
302 c: okay if you'd like me to i have a coupl of sheet in here that i can show you that might be help to keep track
311 c: like you said that you were think about mayb less tv
302 c: so i think it this bottom sheet yep so here someth that might be help this is call a physic activ log and it doe more than track your physic activ you can use it to track how much tv you watch so for exampl let see today is tuesday for exampl if you were to circl one tv for everi 30 minut that you watch today then mayb you could make a goal for yourself to do someth a littl differ the next day
305 c: and how mani calori they think they burn by do it so what do you think of that idea ?
111 t: it sound like a good idea the thing is though we don't even i don't well i don't have cabl realli in my room so i don't watch there ain't noth to watch on tv so i don't watch it the onli time i the onli time i ever do that is like if i'm sleep and just need someth on that that the onli time i ever do other than that the onli thing i do in my room is just sit in my room and listen to music and that it and that that the onli thing i do
325 c: okay so it actual i mean from what you'r say it actual sound like if we you know were to come up with a plan for cut out some tv time that realli that wouldn't make a huge differ caus if i'm understand you correct
106 t: i don't watch it
325 c: you don't watch much of it
302 c: okay so would it be worth mayb look at a coupl other of these handout and see if anyth appeal to you ?
306 c: okay some of them are just list of place to go for thing and we can take a look at those in a moment but here anoth handout that i have that some peopl like to use as a way to come up with a plan for chang that they want to make so this sheet right here just describ for you if you were go to do a workout for weight loss that this is how often it recommend that you do it and for how long that high intens do you have a good sens of what high low and medium intens is ? yeah ?
302 c: so mayb pictur like if you were just stroll down the street not realli tri to walk fast that would be mild or easi intens if you were kind of walk the way you do when you have to go to class not that you'r late for class but just you have to get to your next class and you don't want to be late that would probabl be moder or medium activ and if you were realli late and you were just book it like as fast as you could that would be high intens workout to where you get to the point where you can probabl feel your chest pound so okay and then let see these are some food one yeah the rest of these are food let see your choic that i have in here are i don't know if this is appeal to you or if this would work for you and your famili but there these some of these might be a littl young for you although there boy and girl club for older peopl here ymca and healthi live detroit these are just some place that sometim peopl go to work out if they you know are in a posit where they can get to these place and you know 0:11:47 the membership fee which is pretti low compar to like if you were to join a fit club it would be veri veri high but these are more afford
305 c: do ani of these idea appeal to you ?
112 t: yeah it would help me
305 c: mm-hmm well from here and i don't think i mention this earlier but the point of us meet togeth is not for me to tell you what to do caus you'v probabl had that experi befor where peopl just kind of boss you around and
301 c: say what come next so realli this is your show you know if there are some idea that you'r interest in work on or a plan that you'r interest in come up with so that you can walk away today with someth written down or in your head that say okay today this is what i'm do tomorrow this is what i'm do i can help with that but like i said i don't want to be the one that tell you what to do laugh and we haven't talk about food much either if that mayb a differ path to go down
106 t: well when it come to food wise like like i said everybodi you know we'r all eat healthi we all you know eat what good or whatev we'r all do it becaus my stepfath he a diabet so he also got a work on that too for himself you know everybodi tri to stay healthi too so kind of like so it help me but you know at the same time they'r help everybodi els so it not i don't go out i don't sneak no candi or junk food or noth like that i don't i don't do that you know i probabl have like one i probabl have one a day i probabl eat someth you know that probabl you know a littl fatten but that onli that one day not in a row or noth that onli one day but other than that if it not healthi or good for my bodi i realli don't eat it at all
301 c: okay well so mayb you mayb you i'm offer you some option that realli just aren't what you'r look for or what you think would be use and would mayb anoth option be just to you know have a plan in place for how to get inform about what to do next ? you know what i mean like make a list of like who would you call or if you need to go to your doctor and ask what they would recommend go to the librari you know or on the internet and do some research to find out you know what would be a good plan for you know like a workout routin or you know just like we talk about you know other way of cook that might be even more healthi than what you'r do now
305 c: would that be kind of more what you'r look for ?
112 t: yeah it would
360 c: what'd you say ?
112 t: it would be
301 c: okay alright well if you would like i have a plan that we can take a look at that is just a blank plan and mayb we can think about you know what you might want to do sometim it help peopl to get an idea of what they want to work on just by kind of see how it might be written out so this is an idea of if you want to make a chang like you mention earlier that you'r kind of readi to do someth you just don't know what yet onc we figur out what your plan might be then you write down a motiv statement like whi you would want to follow that plan and then we plan for thing that could stop you from be success like barrier thing that could get in your way of actual follow through on the plan and then solut and then like i mention a coupl time earlier just kind of a an idea for okay what the first step to take ? and then some social support someth someon could do to help you out
117 t: mm-hmm
305 c: so would this be interest for you to talk through ?
112 t: yeah i guess it would help
305 c: okay so some peopl write it down and some peopl just talk about what they might like to do what would work best for you ?
112 t: probabl just talk about it
330 c: okay
107 t: my plan is to i don't want to necessarili i don't want to just lose all this but i do want it to be at a point where it can be like not death defi not a death defi level but so i guess that my plan i want to do this becaus it so mani peopl that i'v lost in my famili becaus of this and so i realli want to live a long life my famili want me to the thing that might get in my way realli the point i'm at the point where there not realli someth that could get in my way back then there probabl was you know caus i was young but like i'm realli at the point where i'm realli commit to this so i don't realli necessarili think that there will be someth get in my way if i see someth if i see some if i see someth then it'll get 0:17:07 i'm not go to eat it i'm not go to touch it or noth like that i'm just go to
313 c: so you'r at the you'r at i guess what i'm hear you say is you'r at the point where onc you know what you'r go to do noth go to stop you
107 t: i'm stick to this
308 c: okay great that sound like it fit right with your motiv
106 t: the thing to reach my goal i guess i guess i got to work on my cardio caus it not the food that i eat i do know that i guess that the onli thing the cardio realli i do do it in gym but that onli onli like an hour in gym
348 c: okay so are you say that like the first step to take is to start do some cardio outsid of school ?
106 t: i i do be walk a lot i do walk a lot but my but my whole year i walk i can walk ani i can walk around the road and not be tire becaus i'm just so use to it the doctor said you can walk as much as you want but if you you have to sweat to kind of work it out if you don't do that then the walk is pointless so i guess i'm go to have to do that like ride bike like ride a bike and stuff i can i can ride a bike anywher i want that that'd be nice but it go to take me a minut for me to start work out 0:18:29 a coupl hour
313 c: sure yeah it sound like you'v got some stamina alreadi but that you can kind of forese that at some point you might reach your limit and need to work a littl
106 t: yeah i may be big i may be big i'm not just total lazi i just big i do work out and everyth but my when he explain workout to me i was talk about benchpress 0:18:51 and whatev that kind of what i would do i did anyway and he said that not good becaus you know muscl weigh more than fat so that so they tri to cut that out but i'm that just what i like to do to reliev stuff off my mind it like one of the thing i do
310 c: well i mean nobodi say that you can't do it at all but mayb you know the idea is kind of what you'v mention is add in some cardio too
308 c: you know and of cours you know follow your doctor instruct laugh but you know but but nobodi say that you know it a bad thing to do thing that you enjoy though you have lot and lot of good idea about other cardio thing you could add in
117 t: that pretti much it
331 c: okay what about that last point ? is there somebodi that you can kind of pictur help you in some way even if it just kind of give you the pat on the shoulder and say hey you did a good job today i saw you out there ?
112 t: i'll say my stepfath yeah he support me a lot with this
328 c: alright so now you have this this plan that you are go to get yourself into good health you know you feel like you know you don't have to be like a stick or anyth but you know you want to make some chang that will be long last with good health benefit for you and you feel like you'v got motiv becaus there are some peopl in your famili who you know who have had some problem and you don't want to have that happen to you and so let me see so you didn't feel like anyth was realli go to get in your way and the first step that you could take was if i rememb correct you'r go to think about you know how you might add in some cardio
331 c: okay and then you feel like your step dad could realli help you out what would he do to help you out ?
113 t: he he cook and so what he'll do is like like he won't cook noth just for me that healthi and then he'll eat someth he will liter cook someth for everyon that healthi he'll be on me about you know get fruit eat fruit what'd you eat today that type of stuff like that so he help me a lot he encourag me to do this becaus becaus he becaus he actual found out that the kid die at the age of 15 overweight and it shook him up he didn't want the same thing to happen to me so it like kind of realli encourag him to go for long and basic encourag me to stick with this and make sure noth get in my way with this so
308 c: well so you have lot of good idea and it sound like you'r realli motiv to go out there and get some of them done so that you know you can reach your goal
301 c: and the thing that we'v talk about today are just kind of a first step just some idea to kind of get you an you know an organ plan that you can follow and sometim down the road you might want to chang it and that fine
305 c: it your plan you know
301 c: laugh and that what happen with peopl as you probabl know you know you get realli good at do someth and you feel like it time to move on to the next thing so that would be a time when you you know decid whether or not you want to make a new plan
117 t: okay
345 c: okay what question can i answer for you ?
117 t: not realli realli i don't realli have ani question at the moment
