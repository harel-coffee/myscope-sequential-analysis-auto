301	c: so miche i was didn really hear if you had any questions about you know what we're going to do today or anything else
117	t: mm no
327	c: ? okay
343	c: so tell me you know where you're at in terms of your weight and what brought you here today
101	t: my mom brought me here today
327	c: mm no mm-hmm so this was something that your mom wanted to do
117	t: mm-hmm
305	c: mm-hmm and what about ?
112	t: yeah i wanted to do it
311	c: okay so even though your mom brought you it was still something you wanted
331	c: well tell me more about you know why you wanted to come
112	t: because i want to lose weight
311	c: okay so your goal is to lose weight
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: so tell me more about that in terms of like what you want
112	t: i really just want to lose weight
310	c: okay so it's kind of that simple you want to lose weight and maybe you're free to find out more about how to do it or where to get started
117	t: mm-hmm
305	c: okay any what are your thoughts about sort of where you want to start in terms of whether you have an idea of how much weight or you just want to get started getting healthier kind of where you're ?
112	t: i really don have a set amount of how much okay but i will have to get healthier
311	c: okay so you don have an idea of an exact number but you know you want to get healthier
331	c: and what are the reasons why you want to get ?
112	t: because i don want to have diabetes when i get older
311	c: okay so for you like sort of health problems when you get older is really a number one reason
117	t: yeah
311	c: okay you mentioned diabetes
331	c: is that something that you know about that you have family members or it's just something that you heard about or something ?
112	t: i might have it when i get older if i don lose weight and my uncle has it my granddaddy has it my auntie has it
328	c: okay so you have like a family history of diabetes and it sounds like you also know for yourself you know that you have some good knowledge about what might happen if you if you don drop some weight or if you continue to gain weight
112	t: inaudible i tried i tried to stop eating late at night i tried to not go to sleep right after i eat
311	c: so late night eating not going to sleep after you eat
106	t: and i try to well i don know if i'm eating healthier but i try
326	c: okay so you want to eat healthier and you sort of tried it but you're not sure if what you did was really the best way to go about it
117	t: mm-hmm
328	c: all right well what i'm hearing is is that you know you're pretty motivated to make this happen and you have some good reasons why you want to make it happen and you've tried a couple things but you're just not 100% sure whether you've been doing the best things
302	c: so with you know with weight right there's usually people talk about exercise and activity you know level or stopping doing sitting around kinds of things and people also talk about healthy eating
305	c: and you know given that we only have so much time today which one of those would you like to focus ?
112	t: healthy eating healthy
311	c: eating healthy okay
302	c: so and i have some other handouts and things you can look at later about you know exercise
311	c: but today it sounds like you want to focus around eating healthy
343	c: okay so you know tell me more about where you're at with your eating right now maybe some of the typical things that you eat and what you might want to do differently
103	t: sometimes i eat sometimes i don eat when i don eat and i finally do eat it's like i want to eat more because i didn eat
308	c: okay so you've already noticed it sounds like you've got a lot of really good ideas that
314	c: you've already noticed that when you kind of stop eating for a while or don eat at all you know that when you do eat then it's like you go overboard because you're so hungry
311	c: so one of the things i'm hearing you say is that sort of managing hunger and kind of figuring out you know how to do that might be helpful okay
331	c: what ?
117	t: that's all i can think of
302	c: okay i have some other thoughts about different areas that you could think about if you want to hear them
305	c: any of those things that you think might be an area that might that you could look at that might help you with weight ?
112	t: sugary drinks
311	c: the sugary ? okay
343	c: tell me about you know how those fit in your life
103	t: some well i really i eat a lot if i haven ate in a few days but i drink more than i eat so = okay like i'm always thirsty so i drink milk i try not to drink so much pop and i drink a lot of juice
328	c: okay so when you have days where you go without eating which you've already identified as like maybe the number one thing you need to kind of look at then you tend to drink all day and you tend to drink sugary drinks and you're avoiding pop which is a good thing but the juice is still there
302	c: so i do have a handout about that are you interested in taking a look at ?
306	c: so how does that make sense to ?
119	t: so basically what you're saying is that i drink a liter within a week i gain a pound
302	c: if you drink yeah close if you drink four cups a day so not over a week because that wouldn be that much right but four cups every day of these drinks and a cup is right like this maybe you know so most people drink like this ? but if you drink four of these a day that's about a pound yeah you got it and so that also means the opposite right that if you cut out four cups a day that would be that would also be a pound trying to think if i have a picture of a cup a cup is about a baseball or a tennis ball so it's sometimes smaller than people think
306	c: so what do you think of ?
106	t: that's something i'll have to stop doing drinking that juice
313	c: drinking juice mm-hmm
326	c: and you mentioned you're thirsty a lot
333	c: so you know what are you going to do if you don drink those ?
106	t: something healthier
313	c: so you want to try to find healthier drinks
333	c: what would those be for ?
106	t: a hundred percent fruit juice
302	c: okay so 100% fruit juice is a good idea in terms of healthier vitamins and stuff like that but from a calorie standpoint it's still going to be the same number of calories
306	c: so what do you think of ?
307	c: it can be kind of frustrating to keep having all these choices laughs and still not enough
117	t: i don know
325	c: well what you're not sure really then what to substitute because if you can drink sports drinks or cola or fast food beverage and now you're even hearing that even fruit juice if you drink a lot of it it still has calories
331	c: so what are drinks that don have ?
112	t: water
311	c: water
302	c: yeah and there are like diet drinks also that don have calories but you know some people don like drinking a lot of those because they're still sweet and have chemicals but at least there are no calories
306	c: so what are you thinking about that water and the zero calorie ?
112	t: i can do that
311	c: sounds you feel pretty confident about that that that is something you can do drinking water =
306	c: and it's okay or you're not so ?
112	t: it have to be cold
311	c: okay so you've already figured out like what you need which is really cold water
308	c: okay so that's a good one
310	c: if it's really cold then you like it and you'll drink more of it
117	t: uh-huh
328	c: okay so basically what i'm hearing is you know you really want to close weight and you want to do it so that you can avoid diabetes and you want to be healthier
306	c: are there other reasons that i missed or is that bout ?
117	t: that's about it
302	c: okay i mean some kids say things like energy or looking different or other health benefits
305	c: but it sounds like for you maybe it's just the diabetes is your main worry
308	c: you already have some really good ideas about what you want to do
328	c: you want to look at maybe not kind of starving yourself for a couple days at a time and then going crazy and maybe trying to eat more regular meals and you also want to look at cutting out calorie drinks
305	c: those are sort of two things that you figured out for yourself so where do you want to go from here what do you want to do ?
101	t: it doesn matter
305	c: okay how about after you leave here today what do you want to do ?
101	t: actually when i leave here i want to go to sleep
327	c: you want to go to sleep you're tired okay
302	c: so let's some teens find it helpful to just fill out a plan so that when you do leave here and after you sleep you can still remember what we talked about
305	c: would that be helpful for you to ?
106	t: stop drinking juice and drink water okay drink more water
313	c: mm-hmm drink more water and you said like cut out the high calorie drinks i don think water  and the second thing you mentioned
117	t: i don really know what
328	c: that was it was talking about like this idea that you that you don eat for a while and then when you do eat you're starving and you go overboard or maybe you make the wrong you know not the best choices is what you said
106	t: so how can i word that eat three meals a day
313	c: okay so for you what you're saying is to eat three maybe smaller meals a day instead of starving yourself and then eating like one huge meal
331	c: okay and why do you want to do this
302	c: this is just the reminder to yourself about you know kind of to motivate yourself
119	t: can spell diabetes
311	c: d-i-a-b-e-t-e-s
119	t: oh i had it right
302	c: okay so one of the his next section talks about what might get in the way and how you're going to overcome it and the reason is that people if they kind of think ahead of time about what might stop them from their plan then they're more likely to do the plan
306	c: so does that make sense to ?
106	t: uh-huh i'm just trying to figure out what would those be
344	c: yeah so what would stop you from drinking more water and cutting out the fruit drinks let's kind of focus on that one first
109	t: the flavor
326	c: lavor okay so if you miss the ?
333	c: okay and what could you ?
311	c: you already mentioned the really cold water
331	c: so how are you going to keep it ?
106	t: put it in the freezer put that under then ?
308	c: yeah i mean i think that was a good idea you came up with
310	c: put water in the freezer or the refrigerator if you don want it you know frozen solid when you're really thirsty
331	c: okay what else with the flavor what other ideas do you ?
109	t: that's it just the flavor
333	c: okay and anything else you can think of in terms of overcoming the flavor or you know =
106	t: inaudible i think they have these little oh sugar free
313	c: okay you can try some sugar free
106	t: they got these little packages
313	c: the sugar free ?
308	c: okay so that seems like a good plan
344	c: is there anything else that you think might get in the way of drinking the water instead of and cutting the juice
313	c: okay so now the second one you mentioned which is the eating the three meals =
106	t: meals a day
313	c: yeah the three small meals a day
344	c: what's going to get in the way of doing ?
109	t: when i'm not hungry
332	c: mm-hmm okay and you know tell me more about that like when you know when it is that you're not hungry
109	t: it can be anytime i just don feel like i want to eat before i'm just not hungry at all
302	c: okay some people find that after they've had those really big meals that they're not hungry for a while or is it just you know or some people think it's the morning or you know certain times of day
306	c: or anything like that for ?
109	t: no no sometimes i just don feel like eating
328	c: okay so sometimes you don feel like eating and you also said but then other times you get so hungry then to the point where you just kind of go crazy you know like go overboard
310	c: so it's sort of like catching yourself when you're hungry a little hungry but not like all the way hungry
333	c: so i don know you know what are your thoughts about how to do that or you know how to catch ?
106	t: eat anyway
313	c: okay so eat the small eat a small meal at regular times you're saying versus waiting until it's too much all right
305	c: so if you think about you know you wake up tomorrow can you how do you imagine yourself doing ? can you even imagine yourself doing ?
120	t: what ?
333	c: mm-hmm like getting up and eating breakfast
112	t: i can do it
311	c: you think you can do it okay like on a scale from one to ten where one is like i don think i can do it at all number ten's like i totally think i can what number are ?
112	t: seven
311	c: you're a seven so you're pretty sure
331	c: what made you say a seven and not a lower ?
112	t: because i wake up early
311	c: you wake up early and you'll be hungry you know at some point when you wake up
305	c: okay okay so if you you can write that or you can leave that
328	c: and you think those that's going to help
305	c: okay what's the first step you're going to ? what's the first thing you're going to do to make this happen when you leave here and after you take your nap or even ? laughs
106	t: drink the water
313	c: okay drink water
305	c: and any of these steps that you can imagine doing maybe even before you go to ? you know before you go back to go to ?
106	t: drink some water because i don want to eat again because =
311	c: okay well the water you mentioned about cold water being really important
331	c: how are you going to have cold water available for yourself like right when you get ?
106	t: yeah because put some ice in it
313	c: using ice instead if it's not in the fridge okay
308	c: all right well sounds like you have a pretty good idea on how you're going to manage these goals and that you're pretty motivated to make them happen
305	c: so this next part is something that and you can write in mom if you want could do
331	c: what could your mom do to help you with ?
301	c: because i'm going to talk to her next
112	t: make sure i eat three small meals
311	c: okay so you think your mom could help you by making sure that you eat three small meals
331	c: how would she make ?
302	c: because that means different things to different teenagers laughs
112	t: remind me
311	c: okay so you'd like her to remind you
301	c: okay and how do you feel about sharing this plan with ? i can do it in different ways i can show her the plan you made i can just tell her or i can kind of just you know in general talk with her and kind of you know until we get to how she might help you
119	t: you can show her
327	c: you can show her
301	c: i can show her okay
306	c: so what we'll do next then is i will talk with your mom alone get you know her ideas and thoughts and concerns show her the plan and see if you know she has any ideas about helping you and then we'll come back together and discuss it
327	c: what do you think of ? you're focused on writing
117	t: oh what =
330	c: it's okay
120	t: i almost messed it up
345	c: oh you were messing ?
345	c: what were you concerned about messing ?
120	t: oh no i was spelling it
327	c: oh okay you were really you were focused on the spelling
301	c: so i'm going to basically i'll meet with your mom next see how she's going to see what her thoughts are show her the plan and you know get her ideas and then we'll come back together to discuss it
306	c: what do you think of ?
117	t: okay
309	c: ? all right so it sounds like i mean we covered a lot of ground in a pretty short time because you're motivated to do this
328	c: and you don want to get diabetes like your uncle you mentioned your grandfather and a couple of other people and you've identified two very specific ways you're going to cut out the calorie beverages drink more water keep it cold so you like it and find ways to flavor it without calories and you're going to try to eat some smaller meals so that you don kind of starve yourself and then go overboard
306	c: okay anything else you wanted to bring up or did we get it ?
117	t: we got it all
301	c: all right great so let me walk you back out and then i'll talk with your mom and then we'll come back together
