345	c: all right all right so demonie lots of fun with the ?
120	t: laughs weird questions
327	c: some a little weird but = = all in all not too ?
117	t: mm-hmm
326	c: so you mentioned some stuff about knowing a lot about what you have to do but the actual doing it part =
109	t: it's not that easy laughs
326	c: and putting it into action can be a little difficult
117	t: yeah
343	c: well before we you know really get into more of that if you like we can-you know how do you feel about your ?
112	t: could lose some
311	c: yeah so you're interested in losing a little bit
112	t: about maybe like 30 40 pounds
311	c: and you have a number actually in mind
112	t: yeah probably about 173
311	c: okay so you have this goal and figuring out how to get there and putting it into action is something that you're looking to do that number sounds like it's something that you've been thinking about for a little while
112	t: yeah i just think that might be a healthy weight for like age range people that have 4:08
308	c: so you're really taking into consideration a lot of big stuff here your health and also what's realistic for how old you are
343	c: tell me a little bit more about the health
112	t: it like 'cause i do have diabetes in my family so i feel like a couple pounds might help me even out where i won be get that bad
311	c: so it's an idea that you kind of see people around you having their health affected by weight and you'd really like to work on preventing that
117	t: yeah
309	c: a smart cookie
112	t: and that might also might help with the asthma as well
327	c: so there are some things going on now that =
120	t: yeah like i i've been good with the asthma i haven had asthma for about three years so i'm a little better
311	c: so you've been managing it well now but it's kind of always something that's over your shoulder =
112	t: yeah like during the summer lately it's been getting even worse so it's like it's a little better might lose a little pounds here and there
311	c: so just taking you know some of the weight off might help you to manage that now and then you're also thinking about health in the future
117	t: mm-hmm yeah
313	c: and we have a chance really to kind of to talk about nutrition or activity
112	t: i need both laughs
310	c: yeah so a combo of both because you know that putting those two together is really the best way to go around healthy weight loss
301	c: would be a good thing for us to talk about today
333	c: all right so what ideas do you have about healthy ways to lose ?
115	t: i know like if i a little more active but just like not really much to do now that it's like the summer i would have like 6:12 try to find something off the internet but i have band practice and summer school so it's like laughs i don really know what i could do
325	c: so even though school's out you're still extra busy laughs with school and with band
109	t: my brother's taking boxing i don want to do that i did karate i was like no i'm good laughs
312	c: so the self defense fighting kind of stuff
109	t: it wasn as much fun as i thought it would be like i did it for about a couple weeks and i'm like okay don want to do this laughs i get bored easy with stuff i don know don know how long the band thing is going to last
308	c: you went and tried something new i really admire that because a lot of people might not even try a new class
328	c: so you know yourself pretty well that maybe you'll get a little bit bored but it really sounds like you look for different things to do a lot so that you keep yourself interested in what you want to do
117	t: yeah
313	c: so band right now is one activity that you have
112	t: yeah that was my 7:22 just go try out for band i was like okay
309	c: dang you just joined the band
119	t: yeah my 7:29 really just getting ready to go home and our bus was late so we were like i want to go to band we actually went there to go buy candy and we end up trying out laughs yeah we didn get the candy though
327	c: well that's a change in your plan
119	t: yeah she was like "we were supposed to get candy" "oh i forgot" "okay"
327	c: we've got other stuff to do now
333	c: so what are you doing in the ?
106	t: i'm playing saxophone i went and got my pieces for the thing for the saxophone the other day i was like okay i don think i can get bored with this laughs
313	c: so this is a very new thing you picked up a new instrument and =
120	t: and i've never played music before so yeah
311	c: so it's gotta be pretty exciting to kind of look at doing new stuff and you know it sounds like you're open to doing a lot of new stuff just out of the blue you picked up this activity
116	t: yeah really spontaneous like "let's go try out for band" "okay" laughs i don know if 8:35 now i'm kind of stuck with it so
311	c: so because you got out you got the new instrument you're really kind of in this activity for a little while
114	t: yeah i think maybe i'm going to try it out i don know how long it's going to last though like once i actually get started okay i'm done with this might sit in the back of my closet likes the karate uniform laughs
325	c: so sticking with things like you said if you get a little bit bored you don always do them
103	t: yeah i quit yeah
333	c: well what about times when you really did stick with ?
120	t: like i don know i stuck with like something likes the writing like i've done that for a couple years now
327	c: that's something you've been doing for a while that hasn really gone away
109	t: yeah but it's not really active laughs
311	c: uh-huh so you're really thinking about these active things that you can do to help with weight loss all right so that's always in the back of your head =
345	c: because that's your goal right now is to think about the weight well what about the writing do you think helped you stay with it for so ?
120	t: i don know it's just like i liked it i think a lot of my family members used to write they don write anymore i don know for some reason i like it i don know why it's just like i stuck with it i have three big books full of writing
327	c: so it's kind of around it's people in your family did it you can quite pinpoint any one thing
328	c: so you keep coming back to this idea of finding active things to do and you know you have the summer school stuff that takes up a lot of your time and then now you started with the band
333	c: tell me a little bit more about the activity in band
112	t: i don really know it's like mostly sitting and like just playing the instrument so right now we're just doing a lot of rehearsing and we do most of the stuff like during the school year like my friend aaron he's in the band they went to atlanta and they went like other places they just went like everywhere and hopefully i'll go i've always wanted to like go visit places so it's like i know that they went so i might stick with it for that laughs like to travel and they have like band camp in the summer but i don go
304	c: so you have the opportunity to do quite a lot of travel if you stay with it for a while but it's not quite that lot of activity that you're looking at for the you know weight loss
112	t: yeah they do a lot of like marching like in parades and stuff
311	c: so one thing that's going on right now is even though right-it seems to be that you're kind of learning the instrument and doing a lot of sitting there is some opportunity for doing actual marching when you go into different parts of the year
333	c: so that's a little something that we have maybe down the road if you're sticking with it to do and what are you thinking about right now for ?
106	t: i'm kind of clueless laughs i really don know like i been 11:47 i don know because we just go outside and play and that's about it i don really like know what to do
328	c: so you're kind of thinking like that it has to be this kind of formal activity and at the same time you're doing activity with your family members kind of outside playing around
302	c: well i have some information about you know what activity goals might be for people during the day would you like to hear something about ?
117	t: mm-hmm
305	c: and if it's something that you've heard of before or it gets a little bit boring just say "hey katie let's talk about something else" is that ?
117	t: laughs yeah
302	c: laughs okay it's kind of it's recommended for health that people try to get about 60 minutes of activity in every day and =
109	t: that's like a long time laughs
312	c: that seems like a lot of =
119	t: yeah when i was in karate it was about an hour and a half
311	c: so you've done activity that's kind of felt that amount of time before actually a little bit over because it's been 90 minutes
119	t: yeah it was like the working out and exercising actually doing like karate 13:05 so
311	c: so it combos =
119	t: and it was twice a week only on tuesdays and thursdays and i had to walk back to my grandma house laughs that's =
311	c: so you were getting way over the recommendations on those days
119	t: yeah some days my mom would drop me off because it wasn near our house it was near grandma my mom dropped me off 13:25 walked to grandma's house which was like two blocks away it wasn that far but it was far enough on hot days and she 13:32
325	c: so you've you know with karate you were kind of going over the needs of the 60 minutes a day
115	t: like okay like when it starting to feel like a routine like okay like i like to do stuff but it's like okay i'm starting to get bored with it i need it more wasn much laughs
311	c: so changing the activities around
112	t: yeah maybe if i did it once a week and did something else or something i don know
311	c: so finding ways not to get bored
116	t: yeah but it's like i could do it it's just like after a while i feel like the same thing 14:22 or something laughs
328	c: so it's not really a matter of the fact that like you can handle that activity for that long so again just finding the right thing for you well you know a lot of times you had mentioned actually one thing a lot of times people do and that's going on the internet to look around for things
109	t: you know like they show like the little commercial the cartoon characters like 14:51 stuff to do it's like nah laughs
312	c: it doesn really fit what you're interested in doing
117	t: no laughs
328	c: so right now you have school and you have band and you're out and about playing with your cousins
117	t: yeah
333	c: what you know kind of time or you know would you be looking to spend doing activity right ?
112	t: like because i haven got my schedule yet i 15:20 so like probably won be at home until like 3:00 and then i'll be like tired from a long day so like mainly the weekend beside stuff
311	c: so on the weekends you can see having time to set aside to do some activity
112	t: yeah like maybe if i could like maybe like twice a week find something to do after school and after practice
311	c: so something similar to what was going on with karate in terms of the schedule adding maybe a day or two days a week
112	t: 15:50 thing go home from school 15:52
311	c: so that even though it was kind of a routine that you got as little bored with going to karate you would be interested in finding something to do during those times during the day
115	t: yeah like something a little more exciting because after a while it got boring so i'm like nah like i get bored very easily laughs
311	c: okay so gotta check out for this boredom thing and what type of ideas do you have that will keep you ? laughs now that it's getting a little bit hotter
329	c: being cool so i'm hearing a couple of things
308	c: and actually you bring up a really great point about this idea of sitting on the computer
302	c: because a lot of times people that sit on the computer for a long time aren being as active as they could be because they're sitting on the computer
311	c: and doesn sound like it's as exciting to you as it used to be anymore
103	t: no not really like 'cause i'm mainly on facebook you know gotta play the games or whatever and it's like not on facebook laughs
312	c: yeah you know kind of same old people same stuff
112	t: yeah i just really say people i don even know just to find something to do but it's like i don like facebook boring now
325	c: so finding something to do that would fit that two days a week and be exciting and not boring would really kind of get your attention and help you increase your activity all right and coming up with that right now kind of drawing a little bit of a blank
112	t: and it's like gotta be something i can get to 'cause we don have our car anymore because we have like a lot of bus routes near us i catch the bus to place like also finding somewhere to get to that's exciting laughs
311	c: and access-right you've got to be reasonable because you can end up walking for forever long or to get there
302	c: well if you if you'd like i know that we have some information about resources around the area kind of a little bit of a handout that i can get it might be helpful to look at together
117	t: okay
305	c: i don know i don know if that really seems up your alley
112	t: laughs yeah just something like i need something
331	c: something to check ?
117	t: yeah
301	c: okay and we do have some time when we'll be in the room with your mom together
305	c: i don know you know would that be something you'd want to kind of talk to her a little bit more about in terms of =
112	t: she may say do everything but yeah
311	c: so she might be like "go go go go"
112	t: yeah like sometimes i need that too like
311	c: so her giving you a little bit of a push isn always all that bad
119	t: yeah i know i tell her i tried out for the band she was like excited i'm like it's just band laughs that was like 19:17
311	c: so she's pretty supportive that you want to do different activities and she sometimes says "just do everything"
112	t: yeah she's like "you can do this or that" like she like she 19:32 my brother lots of times she actually told him about boxing so it's like okay because he doesn do anything he just like doesn do anything laughs so it's like yeah she tries to get us out there it's like certain stuff we will do like him no
305	c: you still i mean you have to make the decision for yourself
117	t: yeah
328	c: 19:56 so kind of around activity it sounds like finding something would be pretty helpful because you're interested in staying excited and doing something maybe a couple times a week
106	t: like 'cause we eat a lot of fruits and vegetables like i don-we don eat that much 'cause like i just lately i haven really had much of an appetite especially during the summer we don really eat-i mean just like 20:43 fruits and vegetables because it's like i like to eat we might have like really good meal like maybe once a week it's like too much and sometime don really eat that much like we always like we have chips or whatever like i said we mainly have fruits and vegetables
313	c: so being in the kitchen in the summer it's too hot and you kind of change your eating style during that time
106	t: and we sometimes be like go to fast food although we might have fast food like twice a month some people it's like not enough because it's like our godsisters they eat that's all they eat is fast food and it's like that's it and they like don get it they eat fruit and they get sick they really had to go to the hospital it was weird laughs i thought it was funny they were scared because they didn know what was going on they had a salad and they got sick and we were just-i just laughed the whole time it was just so funny
327	c: oh that's crazy laughs
106	t: it's like laughs that's i'm like okay maybe i'm going to just stick with the vegetables because like yeah like that's all they do is eat and that doesn happen to most people i'm like think it's best to stick with vegetables and that's it laughs
311	c: so seeing other people eat things like fast food all the time is pretty unhealthy =
112	t: and then have a salad and they get sick like 22:00 okay just going to stick with the vegetables
313	c: stick with the healthier choices here
117	t: yeah
311	c: so you have already lots of fruits and vegetables in your diet
117	t: yeah
333	c: what other ideas do you have about ways that you could you know look at weight loss through eating ?
106	t: like i do snack like i have a lot of snacks but like healthy snacks like i eat a lot of fruit snacks and stuff like that i don know like i have a bag of chips every once in a while some candy but that's about it
313	c: so you're kind of more on the snacking ideas and you really work to balance it between eating things that might taste better like chips and other things that you know that taste good and are healthy for you like fruits and vegetables
109	t: like i know granola bars but they're not really that healthy laughs
302	c: you know we have a little information about types of foods and figuring out you know healthy things would you be interested in hearing about that kind of ? well it's interesting because you mentioned stuff about the fruit snacks and a lot of times those are actually not really have a lot of fruit in them =
109	t: just sugar yeah
330	c: yeah they do just =
106	t: the kind that we eat i think is mott's i don know the kellogg's ones they're just like-they all 23:28 is like the sugar but the mott's ones they're actually made with apple juice and like i don really read the labels on food but that i actually did read and like one day and it's like it is made with like 100% juices like the apples and all that =
308	c: i'm impressed that you're doing so much label reading and you know right away to name off the brands and to tell me what they said that's you know what you're talking about so you're really pretty interested in weight management because you're really noticing things and paying attention to what you're doing
112	t: well maybe reading the mott's box was like i was eating one day i was like "this tastes like actually like the real fruit like i can actually taste the fruit in it" and like i read the box and it said it's actually made of 100% juices and so they might 'cause they =
311	c: and it made a difference in the way it tasted
112	t: yeah 'cause like most are something like thick you can like see through them like you can see through those i'm like "why can you see through ? and it's like because it's made with like real juices and so 24:28 it's neat 'cause they're not that chewy and these taste different than like most stuff and it's like no added sugars like all natural wow laughs
311	c: really makes a difference laughs
112	t: most things that you eat healthy the healthier food doesn taste that great but those are like if i could survive off of those i would laughs they're really good
325	c: so you're noticing that you like the way things that people call healthier foods you like the way they taste more
117	t: yeah
343	c: tell me a little more about that
103	t: i like like some stuff like the corn flakes that supposed to be healthier like they don have any taste like sometimes these things have no taste and i like to add the sugar on because like 25:14 like i love grapefruit i can i really do like one summer that's pretty much all i ate like i just like to squish them and like laughs i 25:25 eat them something like that sugar on them i think that like 25:28 with the healthiness part like the vitamins or whatever
314	c: so you're a little bit concerned because sometimes you have to change improve the flavor by adding things like sugar to the food
103	t: yeah like because sometimes it's like if i eat too much grapefruit its flavor just like kind of goes away so i like some sugar to it
314	c: and you're thinking that when you're doing that the extra calories coming from the sugar make it not as healthy
109	t: and they say like it's better to have splenda and i don like splenda laughs i tasted splenda it's like ugh
312	c: it doesn work for you
112	t: but they're-i don remember which place the bottled water flavored bottle water they use splenda and it's like really good
311	c: so you find some products that you like with the non-caloric stuff and then =
112	t: yeah and you can taste the real fruit in this one 26:20 some better stuff
308	c: you really are looking around and actually experimenting a lot with trying different things and sometimes a lot of people won they'll kind of say like "ew i'm not even going to try that"
106	t: yeah like we drink the-we don have caffeine we don drink caffeine my mama and like we'll have it once in a while like if we have like mountain dew or something but when we drink tea we drink caffeine free tea like the herbal tea and it's like it actually does taste better than like the lipton stuff with the caffeine in it so
313	c: so again you're finding like you did with the fruit snacks =
106	t: yeah like the pop like we drink caffeine free pepsi and actually like the way that one tastes better than pepsi with caffeine like you can taste 27:03 or something and it's better
302	c: you know the thing that you kind of said about the sugar makes me just kind of wonder if you've heard you know any information about this idea of portion sizes
114	t: yeah like i try like-the only thing i eat a lot of is maybe i can overdo it with some tomatoes i love tomatoes and like she has like make a big meal i probably eat like one plate and that's it like i tried for a while i did the portion thing just like it felt weird like everybody's going to get seconds and i'm just sitting there like uh
313	c: so you really held yourself at that point to not go back and have seconds and it was a little tough but you were able to do it
109	t: yeah especially when it was like really really good
309	c: oof wow
109	t: like her lasagna is the best thing ever laughs
308	c: so it was it was a tough-like you did it with-you didn do it with foods you didn like you did it with foods you really like
106	t: yeah like i tried it with everything like when we go to like burger king maybe i'll get two junior whoppers and fries get one junior whopper no fries like i try to wear myself off of it
313	c: so kind of like gradually going down on the portions
333	c: so what's going on with that ?
106	t: like now like when i eat out-actually before-well not now i'm happy with just going and maybe a pop or something like i'm good with a medium pop now so i try to-saw this movie last month on the mcdonald's supersize me so now it's like go past mcdonadl's 28:42 laughs i'm like =
311	c: it really turned you off from it
106	t: yeah i eat everything but mcdonald's i can still go and get their parfaits that's about it
313	c: so making healthy you know choices at the fast food places
311	c: and you're really able to stick with this portion you don seem to be missing the foods that you're eating
116	t: yeah my mom had a book for like eating right with your blood type and i was reading that and all the different blood types i don know my blood type so it's like everybody else in the house eating right for their blood type i'm like okay i just read the book laughs i like don know my blood type i think it's the same as my dad so
325	c: so it's fun to kind of read it but you can quite do everything it says until you find out what your blood type might be
313	c: you do a lot of this information a lot of research on eating
117	t: yeah
305	c: so with all this information that you gathered and all this other stuff you put together in terms of reading the labels and knowing about like the healthy natural foods that you're doing and the portion size stuff you know what is it that you'd kind of like to really work on in terms of the nutrition ?
106	t: maybe like being a little more active and mainly being active and like the eating right kind of thing i kind of got like to me like eating vegetable oil instead of like the other like i don know the other type of oil but 30:11 healthy may eat fried food once a month and that's like she use-like we eat a lot of chicken like she'll try it all different ways like fry it one month and then like the next week we'll have like baked or steamed chicken and i don eat that much pork anymore
328	c: so you've already made a lot of changes to the eating and you're pretty happy with that and focusing on activity might be the way to really bump up your weight loss all right so we kind of go back to that idea of like finding that thing that you might want to try to do two times a week
302	c: a lot of times when i meet with people we kind of put together a little bit of a plan
305	c: how does that sound to ?
117	t: okay
302	c: this kind of you know walks through what your plan you know might be
311	c: and again we talked about a lot of stuff today and it seems like you're really coming back again to that idea of activity
305	c: so what would your plan for this activity what would it ?
114	t: i'm not really sure like maybe-i don know laughs
325	c: so when you're really faced with having to like write something down it's hard to come up with what what you actually want to do
114	t: yeah i actually like i have 31:41 and i'm like uh laughs
325	c: yeah 'cause it can be like right on the tip of your tongue
311	c: and you know we spent a little bit of time talking about that idea of doing something a couple times a week and trying to figure out what that might be
305	c: would that be something that you'd like to kind of work ? or should we try for something ? i mean you don have to write it down for me laughs
114	t: i know like i don have anything to do but it's like how to do it and stuff like we my grandmother she like makes-my great-grandmother-she makes all the different stuff she done 32:34 gravy and all this stuff on it she'll be like it's your favorite but because it's kind of hard to eat healthier around others it's like my main thing how to eat around the other family members and stuff
311	c: ah so once you-'cause you kind of have to deal with outside of being in your house too
305	c: and then that might actually be something you would rather focus on is talking through how to deal with other family members and eating
120	t: mm-hmm like write that ? laughs
305	c: well would you like to write it ?
101	t: no laughs
305	c: not ? you'd just prefer to kind of talk it out a little bit ?
117	t: yeah
333	c: okay so this idea of what to do when you're eating at other people's houses and they make foods that aren quite so healthy how do you get around ?
106	t: it's like you get like she makes 33:35 like a small piece and like not that much gravy or whatever like then i have like a big cup of water something i feel like fill up on that laughs
313	c: so you're already doing things like having the smaller portions
325	c: but still there's something there that isn sitting quite right with you
103	t: no it's like my aunt she makes like a really good macaroni she uses all these different cheeses and it's like that's like unhealthy just too much for me but i still eat it it's like a lot
311	c: so figuring out a way to talk to your family about those types of foods around you might be helpful to kind of reaching your weight loss goal
331	c: okay and is this like who's somebody in your life that could kind of help you talk to those ?
116	t: i don know laughs like me-i don know because it's like they do for like my grandma she knows like we don eat the caffeine so like she'll-like if we spend like-last summer i spent a couple weeks at her house so it's like she just stocked up on like kool-aid and like fruit juice like and refresh and 'cause we don like-'cause she like supports it and likes the healthier food she's like just eat laughs so it's like and like my great-grandma like she doesn eat that much anymore because since her-she had surgery so it's like she eats less and less now so like everybody's kind of trying it but it's like so every once in a while like during the barbecues and whatever like everything's drowned in barbecue sauce or something
311	c: so a lot of people in your family are making some small changes to be healthy
109	t: but it's still a lot
326	c: but there's still more that they can do or that you're trying to do and it's hard to do when there's other foods around that are really really good
333	c: so if you do go to a barbecue and all those foods are around you know what are some things that you could ?
106	t: like we went to a barbecue last week and then had the ribs and hamburgers and hot dogs and i just had a grilled chicken 'cause they had grilled a chicken and i had that and potato salad and that was like it so i guess it sounds healthier but i don
313	c: so you again are kind of making changes on your own
117	t: yeah
308	c: and really working hard even when you're out with your family and everything's around and everybody's eating all this stuff that you really like to eat to make changes there
116	t: yeah like yesterday for father's day we went to a country buffet and i think all i had was some macaroni and grilled chicken and some peach cobbler and that was it like everybody else is eating like tacos and everything and i'm like i'm just going to sit here laughs but
307	c: must be pretty difficult though to kind of sit around and watch everybody else eating
116	t: yeah it was okay because i had the peach cobbler and like i kept going back for slushies i love slushies but it's like i mean because i kind of think slushies are healthy because i mean like ice but i also feel like all those artificial colors and sugar in it so
325	c: so again you're kind of getting back to like well some part of the food is healthy and some part you're not quite sure about like with the grapefruit adding the sugar and things
117	t: yeah
302	c: you know i have some information about beverages if you'd be interested like you know how to-what you're drinking and energy and that
305	c: is that something you wanted to look ?
109	t: i love gatorade like i can survive off gatorade like i love to drink gatorade but then someone's like it's not healthy like there's a lot of acid and whatever in it but she was like it's like drinking pop and i'm like but it's gatorade it's an energy drink i love gatorade
307	c: so sometimes it's hard to figure out with all the different names of things how much energy is in them for your body
305	c: well this little information here-and again as we're going through it just be like "katie this is boring" if you need to ?
302	c: so this is actually talking about what are you drinking and it talks about this idea that a lot of time sports drinks energy drinks anything that's like a fruit drink or flavored iced teas and a lot of soft drinks really have little or no nutritional value and drinking a liter or more of these a day could actually look like in a week about one pound a week
103	t: yeah i just had about that 12 ounce bottle of gatorade before you came in here laughs
314	c: yeah so i mean it sounds like it's something that you know you do have in your life it's one of the things you're drinking
310	c: and so one of the best ways to know what's in the food that what you're drinking is what you're already doing with the fruit snacks which is
112	t: reading the labels
311	c: reading the labels yeah
305	c: so this yeah go ahead and peek through whatever you want to do with it
302	c: so it actually really just kind of talks about the amount of calories in different types of food and their sizes
114	t: yeah when my brother went to i think it was a dietician or something back before he had surgery and she gave him something like this with all the different drinks and the foods like he can have like a certain amount of this 39:16 like we love kool-aid like we have like 16 packs of kool-aid right now in our cabinet laughs and so we like man we have to cut back but it's hard especially when you like really want something
326	c: yeah it kind of goes back to that what you were saying when you know there are things that you know but actually putting them into action can be really tough
314	c: so this is not something that's new to you in terms of you know having a lot of calories in what you're drinking and it doesn really make you feel very full
114	t: yeah like me like i drank crystal light before i don really like it though
325	c: so it's not the same as gatorade it's not the same as kool-aid
314	c: but you are realizing that you do drink a lot of calories =
114	t: yeah like we don drink-we don have skim milk or 1% we drink 2% milk it's like we some reason like makes our stomach hurt so all we drink is 2% milk and like we have cranberry juice a lot we drink that a lot like we have the cocktail one and the natural one i like the cocktail one better laughs
312	c: so it kind of goes back to you know liking the way that things taste
305	c: well this was just kind of some information that you can do whatever you would like with
310	c: in terms of you know thinking about what you're drinking and keeping in mind that sometimes people drink a lot of calories that they don know about
117	t: yeah
328	c: so we were kind of talking about the idea of what to do when you're with the family members and the different food comes out and how you kind of talk with that and then we jumped over to talking about the amount of calories in certain drinks that we're doing and we also talked about stuff with activity that's a lot of different things that we kind of covered today
301	c: and we have a little bit of time left before your mom comes back in
305	c: you know and if you really had to kind of think about what you'd like to take from this and whether or not we write out this plan or don write out this plan that's up to you but what is it that you'd kind of like to work on as your goal coming out of ?
106	t: mainly just being a little more active big part of it
313	c: so really going back to that activity activity piece
106	t: 41:47 i do eat really healthy and but she doesn think i'm active enough that's like the big thing that i could be more active
311	c: so you're kind of hearing it from other people
117	t: yeah
331	c: and what do you think about being more ?
114	t: sometimes i really don want to but it's like okay sometimes like if i get bored i'll go walk to the library and then like i'll walk around around the library me and my friends we'll like just walk around at the park because the park is like across the street from the library and then like i come home sit on the porch and then go in the house 42:23 there's not really much to do around my neighborhood so it's like just bored it's like a lot of the kids moved away so it's just me and my brother on our block like him he actually somehow i don know how he finds the other kids and like they'll just go out and i just be stuck there like laughs
325	c: so finding other people to kind of hang out with and do things like walk around the neighborhood but it's not always very much fun
117	t: no laughs
313	c: and you've done quite a bit of research on the internet trying to find something that really grabs your interest in terms of activity
106	t: it be like at school i don really eat a lot of the school food they have like these salads so i eat like a salad like every day maybe once a week i'll eat something else
330	c: so it's going to back to this idea that you're =
345	c: you ? laughs
313	c: so it's kind of going back to this idea that the eating part of things is something that you're really working on and making some really active changes with like your portion sizes
325	c: but the activity part you know is where you're kind of like "hmm i'm not quite sure what to do with it now"
345	c: you need some ? okay all right do you want to get it right ?
117	t: yeah
301	c: okay 43:55 well so we're back so you know what are some things then that i can talk to your mom about in terms of the activity ? and the eating stuff too
119	t: like she'll probably say i'm okay with the eating like i don really know what she'll think about activities she'll probably say more activities laughs yeah
305	c: and how do you feel about me kind of sharing with her this idea that you're looking for things to do and you want to make sure that it's exciting and maybe something a couple times a ?
117	t: yeah okay
301	c: so we'll kind of see what maybe she has to say about ? all right i'll have you go ahead and switch places with her then
