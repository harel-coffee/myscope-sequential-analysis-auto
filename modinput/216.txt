301	c: work done answered all those questions al right so i should let you know that we are going to go ahead and turn the cameras on now like they mentioned when you were signing all the paperwork and checking that that's okay with you you don ? great
305	c: and then also just to let you know that we're here to talk about nutrition activity and weight loss and really i'm not here to tell you what to do because a lot of times telling people what to do isn really helpful but i'm just more here to just see if there's anything that you both want to work on and i know we only get to meet one time see if that's helpful at all ?
327	c: all right so no problems so far laughs
343	c: all right well how do you feel about your ?
112	t: don like it
311	c: all right so it's something you're ready to make a change in yeah and you've got some particular reasons for not really liking it
115	t: actually had nothing to do with me or whatever because personally and i know it's unhealthy but i'm fine or whatever it's just people so i get sick of it
311	c: so other people are really making comments about your weight
117	t: yeah
307	c: and it's getting on your nerves laughs yeah all right
311	c: so those other people really are saying enough that it's bothering you that you do want to do some things
301	c: we have a chance to talk about either nutrition stuff or things related to physical activity or we can talk about both
305	c: what would you like to really focus on in our time ?
112	t: nutrition
311	c: the food side of ? all right
305	c: so when you think about nutrition and losing weight what ideas do you have on things that might work for ?
114	t: inaudible 'cause like i lived with my grandma and i've lived with my mom and my grandmother you know she was a salad rabbit type eater you know and i ate-she ate you know it was just like that and then i've lived with my mom and who's not a rabbit type eater laughs you know so and like i didn really see the difference you know like i just stay the same and that kind of hurt me too so
325	c: so you have kind of lived with people that have had very different eating styles and you've done the same thing and it hasn made a difference in your weight which made you think like what the heck is going ?
305	c: all right so the salad the rabbit type of eating versus not you had no problem doing either but again when you're talking about weight loss you didn see anything so you're kind of wondering what is it going to take like what's the stuff that i need to do to make things go well tell me a little bit more about your ideas you know based on where you're living right now
120	t: what do you ?
329	c: i gotta i gotta make more better questions huh
327	c: so you kind of have some-you've been doing different things in terms of eating different styles
302	c: and while i have some information that people might you know we could go over if you'd like some people might like to talk about it in here as far as like ways that people can look at cutting calories and eating healthy
305	c: what ideas do you have about what you could do right now to cut those things ?
114	t: i'll eat and then lay down you know like that or i'll get on the computer or something like that and i know i need to like i guess do something active or whatever so i guess i have to change that and i don eat like on time you know i don eat breakfast my lunches are like when i get home from school it's like four i eat dinner around like ten go to bed around like two so i know it's not healthy to do that either i don know i eat when i'm bored i know that
308	c: so already you're really aware of a lot of things that you're doing around eating and activity if you're mentioning stuff about laying down and being on the computer that honestly a lot of other people don really catch on to
311	c: so you're kind of coming up with the idea that a little bit of inactivity is one thing that you could possibly work on another one being more working on like regular meals and then the watching like the snacking or the eating when you're bored
305	c: so if you really had to pick one to focus on
302	c: one small thing at a time
117	t: yeah
327	c: something you've heard of ? laughs
305	c: you know what if any of those would you like to focus ?
112	t: eating when i'm bored that's a big problem that's my biggest one i think
311	c: all right so finding things to do when you're bored other than eating
117	t: yeah
333	c: so what types of things could you do instead of ?
114	t: i don know like i don mind going places or being out you know or walking or whatever i don mind exercising i just don like to do it by myself so like i don really have anybody i don like-my mama is comfortable the way she is you know since she doesn want to change so that's out my best friend you know he lives all the way on the other side of town where i used to live and i'm not where i live i tend to-it's an apartment complex and it's like a lot of houses but not a very talkative person you know i don really know anybody like that so i don know
310	c: so you already kind of know yourself really well in saying that if you had somebody to do something with you wouldn feel as bored
119	t: yeah he came over like not yesterday but the day before yesterday or whatever and start out the whole day just walking around apartment but he wasn there i wouldn have did that i would have been in the house on the computer or something like that
310	c: so you're a lot more active when you have people to be around with as well
312	c: you're less likely to do the waiting but right now you know it sounds like you've kind of moved recently and you don know a lot of other people around there and your mom isn really somebody that wants to be out and about be active this is something you've talked about with her before
109	t: it's just like i lived with my grandma for like two years and that was one of the major things or whatever was that she kept trying to change me like how i weighed or whatever and it wasn so much i didn want to change just the way she was going about it was not right or whatever and my mom and my grandma got into an argument about it and it was just like i guess a constant thing that my mom didn want to change or anything like she kind of related to me and told me and stuff so it's never like never came out asked her like but it's just a question i know the answer to yeah
312	c: so you kind of moved back home moved back in with your mom because your grandma was really pretty bothersome about your weight and you don know about talking to your mom about it you know the answer and you also don want to cause that kind of conflict that happened with your mom and your grandma
117	t: yeah
305	c: how would you feel if you did talk to her about you know being more active or doing things together in the time that we have here ?
109	t: i would rather didn you know like i don see where that would fit in that she's like i have somewhere to go from ten to two thirty she drops me off in the morning then my brother has swim practice and she drops him off then she has five kids and not a big enough truck because she goes to work on her other truck and my two youngest brothers don live there so she goes to see them and i don see how that would fit in
328	c: so you really have kind of assessed the situation and your mom's not really the best person to talk to about that and your friend your best friend lives across town so you don get to see him very frequently
120	t: i mean we see each other but like  i don believe we've ever gone a week without seeing each other whatever but it's just when we do it's it's planned out or it's not planned out you know like oh i seen him at the mall you know yeah so
310	c: so you're looking for something to do that's more regular because you know that the eating when you're bored is something that's happening every day and you'd like somebody that's there a little bit more frequently to do things with all right
120	t: i wanted a dog but we live in an apartment can get dogs there
307	c: that's kind of tough when laughs where you live doesn let you do those kinds of things all right
328	c: so finding that person to you know kind of hang out with and to be more active with and to cut down on the eating when you're bored sounds like the thing that you're really looking for right now and you're having trouble coming up with who that person could be and you mentioned people around the complex but you don really know then very well and your mom's out and other members of the family might not fit with what you're looking for either
117	t: yeah
333	c: so if this person is kind of really that important part of you you know making some changes with your activity and the eating when you're bored how do we find that ?
115	t: well i don i don believe it necessarily have to be-i don know i don want to say it doesn have to be a person but  i don know if i just i got something to do you know just just to do like  i don know
310	c: so if you kind of had your thing doesn have to be that you're waiting for somebody else to be like okay i'm here to do-it's more if you had a schedule you had something planned
112	t: yeah i like a schedule
311	c: all right so having that structure something you like it works well for you
112	t: yeah i discovered that when i went to the hospital so yeah i like the  i don know it's just not necessarily the people telling me what to do but just knowing i guess
311	c: all right so you in the past when it's happened you really likes the fact that there was again the structure this is what's happening today this is what's going to be going on
117	t: yeah
305	c: so how would you go about putting something like that in what you're doing now if you wanted to in terms of like you know an activity or eating the ?
114	t: um because like a lot of stuff happens like off plan you know like my mom cooks on mondays you know so it's like every other day besides that either she brings home something to eat or it's like get a hot pocket you know or whatever it is and i mean i can cook that's what i want to go to college for so it's like it doesn really matter but i was going to say-oh like i don know like sometimes she comes home inaudible cooks or whatever so i don want to start cooking and then she'll be like "i was going to cook" or i don want to cook for my brothers or whatever and she brings home something and
325	c: so it's the-it's kind of like this unknown what's going to be happening for meals
308	c: and you are really you know kind in the fact that you don want to start something and then kind of upset what your mom had in mind for the scheduling and do that ?
305	c: well if you you know had a chance to talk to your mom about some stuff since we do have some time together today when we're done with the session what would you kind of want to share with her about getting in the ?
101	t: no
305	c: this isn something you want to talk to her about this is something that you really want to do on your own
312	c: so structuring the meals since it's really family-based is too difficult to do
305	c: and it really has to be something that kind of comes from you working on without having to have your mom change her schedule or things like that
117	t: yeah
309	c: okay and it tells-i mean you've really been you know the way that you're kind of sharing this stuff with me you're really thinking through options like you're coming up with ideas
325	c: and youre not quite sure if theyre going to be working or not
311	c: but the one that you come back to is that idea that you really did like when you were in the hospital that idea of structure there was some kind of a schedule and it worked really well for you</tex
117	t: yeah
333	c: and it won really-you can really get structure in terms of the days or i'm sorry like the meals and anything what could you structure in your ?
116	t: i guess what i do instead of being on the computer and you know just set a time limit or whatever because like there's stuff i like to do but  i don know
311	c: so there's stuff that you like to do
331	c: and you're thinking about giving yourself like this time window to do it tell me a little bit more about that
112	t: i mean not necessarily there's a time limit but i was just thinking of the fact how long i be on the computer or watch tv or whatever i wanted to take a class over the summer it was a cake decorating class or whatever wanted to do that there in k-mart and there was some think it was like make a purse or something like that and i like to do little stuff like that but  i don know just
325	c: so you're finding stuff that looks like fun fun classes to go out new people learn new things that are things that you might learn when you go to school you know your career in the culinary world and there's something stopping you from being able to do them right now
109	t: my grandma mainly she's really weird i don know she thinks a lot of things are pointless you know so
312	c: so she doesn really see the point to it
307	c: and that's really tough because every time you find something get excited about it she's there to say no
329	c: but those types of things-sorry if i bumped you
328	c: those types of things are really stopping you from kind of getting out of the house and doing less of the tv and the computer stuff and you see that that's one way that you can really work on stopping the eating when you're bored now you mentioned that your grandma really has kind of been tough on you about your weight
119	t: yeah and the thing that makes me mad is likes because she's a depression too or whatever and it really irritates me like that this year or yeah this year-last school year the beginning of the school year i wanted to go to homecoming or whatever and she sold these-i guess they were called body magic suits or something like that and they were supposed to make you lose some type of weight well not lose it but appear to lose it and i didn want it but she told me i had to get it or whatever and we ordered my homecoming dress offline and she ordered it too small because the suit or whatever was supposed to i guess or whatever and then like when it got there she told me to try it on my mom was staring at of course you know i couldn fit it she was like "well you need to lose some weight to fit into it" or something like that and i got like really mad and 'cause i felt like not so much as like i didn want to lose the weight because that probably would have been motivation you know like i really wanted that dress or whatever but two days before homecoming you know that's kind of like impossible and only she wound up getting me the thing and it did fit and everything but it was just a point was
307	c: the way that it went about it what a tough thing to get your dress right before the dance and to hear that
117	t: yeah
311	c: but for you it sounds like having a little bit of a kind of a goal in mind with a reasonable time frame for weight loss is something that's helpful to kind of keep you on track with thin
307	c: yeah i'm really sorry that that happened with all the work to get and excitement for the dress and stuff yeah
301	c: we don have a ton of time left for our little portion to talk today
308	c: and i want to say thanks for sharing a lot of stuff with me in terms of what's going on and really the great ideas that you have
328	c: being aware of the fact that you're eating when you're bored
302	c: and that's kind of a way that people can have extra calories throughout the day
328	c: and then this idea of watching how much time you're inactive you've kind of suggested scheduling things and that
305	c: and i don know if there's anything in particular that you really want to focus on after leaving here today
101	t: no
312	c: you can really think of anything that jumps out at you
310	c: so it might be more that it's just you're going to kind of think about you know what you could do to help with the weight loss
117	t: yeah
343	c: well if you had like a scale of one to ten where one would be not at all important ten would be very important excuse me how important is it for you to find something to focus on in order to lose ?
112	t: a ten
311	c: so it's on that very important range
331	c: what made you say a ten and not a lower number again eight or a ?
112	t: because i know i'm unhealthy and i don like it
328	c: okay so it's really this idea that you're ready for some changes to move forward all right and finding that thing is kind of the tough part you know making the decision on what to do and what to stick through
308	c: yeah well i mean the ideas that you already have are really smart you know solid ideas and so you come in with a lot of really great information so all right it's just a matter of you know really maybe finding the thing that is right for you
307	c: but you've actually been working with a lot of people in your life that have kind of been hard on you for your weight
308	c: so i really admire the fact that you came in here today anyway and you wanted to talk about it even more
302	c: so yeah there is some information in here that i'll kind of share when we come together in the end about eating and activity and we also have a program that's going to be coming up starting next year that is much more than one session it's about six months long and you know you'd meet with somebody about twice a week so if that sounds like something you're interested in more information about 'cause you don get a lot done in one single session then you can let me know and i'll be happy to give you that info ?
117	t: okay
