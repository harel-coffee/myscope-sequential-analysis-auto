345	c: toya and sarah yeah they'll let you know what's happening out there laughter how's it ?
117	t: all right
327	c: cool got done with summer school and here you come for more stuff to do more work
117	t: yeah
301	c: well we have some time today to kind of talk about things having to do with nutrition and activity
343	c: and i just wanted to know how do you feel about your ?
112	t: i mean like like i don know how to put it but like sometimes i be mad because like like me and my friends will be playing at hide and seek like sometimes i be the one to get caught sometimes they'll be the one to get caught
311	c: so it kind of interferes sometimes with playing with your friends
112	t: sometimes but not a whole lot what ?
331	c: so there's a little bit there with just being around your friends
117	t: that's about it like that's about it
310	c: so for the most part you're pretty comfortable with your weight
117	t: well
329	c: you as i didn get it i'm sorry
345	c: you are you are pretty as you are unsure about why you're here to talk to ?
116	t: oh i'm okay with it
329	c: okay so it's not a big deal that we're here to talk about it
302	c: well i have some information related to why you might be here today and it has something to do with something called your body mass index do you want to hear about ?
116	t: it's okay
310	c: and i guess when you say it's okay i don know if you mean like it's okay i don want to hear about it or it's okay i do want to hear about it
305	c: and this is really kind of like your show so if we're talking about something that you don like or it's boring or anything like that you can be like "katie let's move on"
306	c: okay does that make ?
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: so would that be something you'd like to see or not ?
112	t: i mean like i can
331	c: okay cool so what if anything have you heard about body mass index or ?
119	t: this is my first time ever hearing about it
302	c: all right so it's a new thing all right well to kind of put us on the same page your body mass index or your bmi actually talks about as it's a number that talks about what your weight is in ratio to your height and then they take that number and they tell you what your disease risk might be in relation to your weight so at your age you're actually plotted on a growth chart you are compared to all the guys that are your age so when we look at the growth chart here you actually fall for other boys your age above the 99 percentile in terms of your weight or your body mass index and that puts you right here in this gray no dark gray area meaning that out of 100 boys your age you would weigh more than about 99 of them and your disease risk would be a little bit elevated because you're in this gray area
324	c: so not too interesting
120	t: so this is where i should be at and this is where i am at or this is where i should be at this is where i ?
307	c: oh so it's a little confusing to look at it
329	c: so i didn do a good job of explaining
302	c: well this idea here is that this lighter area down here would be considered of a healthy weight range this is a healthy weight range and this would be kind of getting higher and then this would be increased risk of diseases related to your weight
120	t: so this is where i am at but this is =
302	c: you're this one right here
120	t: and i should be right ?
302	c: bringing this down into other areas
310	c: because you're kind of interested in how to get into a healthier place or where you should be
302	c: okay so yeah bringing this part down actually decreases your possible risk for diseases and what would you =
119	t: so the light shaded part should be right here
302	c: so it's more that this isn a very good picture
119	t: i just don know how to read it
329	c: again i'm not doing a very good job of explaining am i
120	t: i mean you is as it's probably just me
308	c: not at all
302	c: so what this is saying is you're right and you're saying that you as people who are in a healthy weight range are in this area down here and then as they get up higher into the darker range up here then it's a less as it's not as much of a healthy weight so people that drop their weight or drop their bmi into a healthier range have better health
306	c: how is that making ?
120	t: so like this black line would be ?
302	c: so this the dark one that's going through is kind of throwing us a bit it's actually this is where you're at right now you're this dot up here and you know your age and applying your bmi
120	t: and i should be right ?
311	c: and you're interested in how to get as where you should fall
302	c: and falling into a lower part even if it's not all the way down here will be healthier for you
306	c: so what do you make of that ?
120	t: um i got another question too how much overweight am ?
305	c: you actually want to hear some kind of a number or just an idea of how much overweight that you ?
112	t: like an idea
311	c: like an idea
302	c: well if you were to be in this range right here because this is your age coming up here right if you were to be bring this down into this range like that lighter part that would put you at overweight into this overweight range and then if you bring it into this other part down here that would be more into that would be a normal weight range
308	c: i'm really impressed with how many questions you're asking to make sure that you understand this information you know i work with a lot of people and they just look at this and they say "oh yeah yeah sure i understand" and you know you're really checking in and asking some great questions so that it's clear for you
306	c: so what do you what do you think about that info of seeing where you're at and kind of thinking about weight and ?
115	t: i think that i need to try and lose it but like last time where i went they had they gave me some inaudible thing to do but i didn see the video on there
310	c: so somebody talked to you about this before and you tried to use whatever they gave you
112	t: yeah and it didn work
312	c: and it didn work
307	c: and that was pretty frustrating because here you took the time to look for it it wasn there
333	c: all right well what other things have you tried =
106	t: like me and my friends like we run around a lot but not a lot but like we play manhunt and like my other friend dog get out sometimes and we ran after the dog a lot but like sometimes you just walk around being like as from my grandma's house i walk to my summer school and that's as my grandma house is like you know where atworth is ? well my grandma's house is close to inaudible and i got to walk down to west grand boulevard then walk back home
313	c: so there are times in your day that you're being active whether it's running around with your friends and the fact that you have to get yourself to summer school
310	c: but it's also that you kind of mention that you're sometimes being active so there might be a little bit of room for you to be more active if you wanted to
302	c: so activity is one thing that you're definitely that people do in order to help to manage their weight and to lose weight and the other side of that would be the nutrition part
301	c: so we have a chance to kind of talk about either of them today
305	c: which would you like to talk ?
112	t: me and like losing weight
345	c: you're not quite sure why as what we mean by like the nutrition activity for weight ?
119	t: i thought like that falls up under losing weight
302	c: so it's the idea that some people are as will do things to you know increase their activity or choose the types of things that they're eating in order to lose some weight
305	c: so which one do you want to talk about today if any of them because again like i said this is really kind of for you and you might be at a place where you're not even sure again why you're here or why we're talking about weight loss in the first place
117	t: i would i don know
325	c: you're not sure what you want to talk about
305	c: would it be all right with you if i put this away for now or do you want to keep it out to ?
117	t: you can
324	c: funny looking cameras
332	c: laughs so if you were to you know think about where you see yourself in about five years or so and you didn make any changes to your weight what do you see ?
112	t: i mean like everybody saying that you can die from being overweight so maybe death
311	c: so pretty serious effect of weight and other people are talking to you about that
116	t: like my stepdad he talk to me about it he be like he be like you could die from it you could have a heart attack and all that but like he say it so much to the point like as like when he said it to me he normally say that he be making fun of it but now that he said it like sometimes i take it serious and sometimes i don because like how do i know you not playing and he a good actor so
325	c: so he kind of goofs around a lot and you're not really sure if what he's saying is true
311	c: but it's something that he brings up quite a bit =
119	t: well he mostly say it like like if he just got done drinking like on father's day i mean not father's day the day when the basketball game had came on he was drinking like he done brung it up so i looked at him like "ain nobody in the mood to play why you talking to me about this"
328	c: so he's acting up a little bit and he kind of knows how to pick at certain topics that might bother you but you're able to defend yourself get around it but it still bothers you a little bit that that's what he goes for other people in your family are talking about weight too
106	t: like they tell me like they be like "malik you need" as like my grandma she tell me sometimes like "malik you looking like you slimming down" which is i have because like all of my clothes feel a lot bigger and like when i was around like 230 like last summer i went to the doctor i was like almost like 242 or something like that and like since i did that i been running around cutting grass all of that so like i guess it all adds up like all of my clothes like sometimes i used to be able to just fold down the top of them but now they still comes out
313	c: so you made some changes last summer after going to the doctor's and seeing your weight and it sounds like you are being more active and you're seeing the differences in your clothes along with other people noticing too
308	c: so wow so you made changes and saw some results yeah
313	c: and you mentioned you know some activity stuff
333	c: what other stuff are you ?
106	t: like just run around a lot and playing manhunt hide and seek and tag and all of the other stuff
313	c: so being active with your friends is one way that you you know helps with weight loss
333	c: so what other ?
103	t: inaudible i mean sometimes like like i be outside but like a lot of times it's on the computer and stuff
314	c: so you're noticing that while sometimes in your day you are out a lot of times you're sitting around and doing things that are less active
106	t: i mean like it's it's half and half but most of the time i'm outside because like the computer get boring now so most of the times i just go outside
313	c: so plus with the computer but it's still there and you're noticing that the less time that you're spending on the computer or other yon know kind of sitting around things the more you happen to be outside and moving around
308	c: that's pretty interesting because you know it sounds like you already know one of the great ways that people help to lose weight and that's to cut down on their sedentary activity you know that idea of like watching tv and playing games and being on the computer
106	t: but like when i'm at my granny's house the only activity that i really do now is like take out the trash like if she need to get inaudible go to the store for her but and stuff like that but like over there i don have =
308	c: you're a good grandson aren you
120	t: i'm all right like sometimes she just flips though like me and her we be going at it but i like staying at my grandmother's house more than i like staying at home
312	c: so it's good to be over there but like you were saying
329	c: before i interrupted you i'm sorry
312	c: was that there aren a lot of people over there for you to play with
106	t: i mean my godsisters and them live down there but they older so like we don really play but like my niece she's i think three so like i run around outside with her like she like "i bet you can get me" so i run out there but like sometime she be on her bike and then i give her a headstart and then i run after her i let her get like four or five houses ahead of me and then i run after her
313	c: so while it's not the same as being with your friends you get to hang out with some more of the family and play with your niece
117	t: yeah
309	c: a good uncle
304	c: but you are noticing that even you know when you're at the place you like to be at your grandma's more than you like to be at home you're being less active
106	t: i mean i'm still active but like like i just don do the same like i'll say out of a hundred i do like 60% of what i do at home
304	c: okay yeah so you're definitely over that half of the amount that you're doing at home but you're seeing that there's that 40% difference with what you would normally do when you're at home and the fact that you're noticing it is you know interesting =
106	t: and like at home like we don really play for team like football teams and that like we all boys and like ain none of us scared to get hurt break a bone or anything so like we go down the street and we play tackles and stuff
310	c: so when you're at home with all your friends it's you know pretty heavy duty you can do more of the sports and things that you can do at your grandma's
106	t: mm-hmm but like at my grandma's i can still like throw the ball and then test my running to see how fast i can catch the ball and stuff and plus i notice that i lost weight because it was like like i never been able to jump as high as i can now
313	c: so your clothes are fitting you differently and you're seeing that you're able to you know play sports a little bit better jump higher and do things differently with the weight loss well you know we're talking a lot about activity today and a lot of really positive things that you're doing
305	c: so it sounds like you know activity might be more of the thing that you would like to do in order to think about maybe focusing on the weight if that's what you wanted to do as opposed to like talking about eating and nutrition
114	t: well like with eat and like like i like eating fruits and vegetables but like sometimes like sometimes i just come in the house and i just want to eat and like if i wake up in the middle of the night and i get hungry then i eat
310	c: so sometimes when you're just coming home and and you're hungry and so you don necessarily pay as much attention to like portions or things you just want to eat what you want to eat
112	t: like if i went outside right now and i was hungry i would probably come in the house probably make me like a bowl of cereal or eat a hot dog drink some water and go back outside or either just eat an orange or apple and just go back outside
311	c: so kind of go in there eat something get back outside
103	t: but like sometimes like my friend inaudible he stay on punishment if it was a world longest you could have been on punishment he would have broke it so like sometimes his mom will let him do stuff and sometimes she don but so like sometimes if i'm hungry like i be so bored in the house because like i like been on the computer a lot so they take the mouse so like like i eat and then like i lay down and then i say i'm going to have to watch tv or play the game and then before i do that i end up going to sleep so
314	c: so people in the house are actually trying to cut down on the computer time and they'll take the mouse away from you so you can use it and then if you're bored you eat and it makes you tired
116	t: no i don eat because i'm bored i just eat like if i get hungry then i eat but i'm like if i was at home right now and i was bored i wouldn just go in the house like hungry and just eat something
310	c: so it's not really you know it's more that you're just kind of sitting around you get sleepy and you lay down because your friend when he's on punishment can hang out and play
109	t: i mean i got a lot more other friends but like sometimes walking around the corner a lot of times get boring and plus my friend bernard he always got his company over like his girlfriend or best friend or whatever we get tired of all as i get tired as we get tired of hanging with her all the times because like she be over today she be like oh well i'm about ready to go home by the time we already leave or something she right back over there like she know where inaudible houses is so she'll come to one of our houses
327	c: you can get rid of her
120	t: right she like she like a fly on a sticky plant
312	c: laughs that's pretty serious huh so you can really play tackle in the middle of the street if she's hanging around all the time
109	t: yeah plus like like even if we do like she be getting on my nerves because like she be like oh you weenie you couldn tackle him and like to me she a pain in the butt
312	c: and so you don really want to be around them as much
120	t: well like i i tolerate her because i don know how to say it but like her mama abandon her like one time her mama told her like "man i don even want you i just want you for your daddy's child support or to get food stamps and stuff" it's like i tolerate her but after a while sometimes like we just argue a lot
312	c: so you know all in all you try to be nice with her but she kind of gets in the way of you playing being with your friends and doing a lot of the things the active things that you and your friends like to do
307	c: that can be pretty annoying
333	c: so how do you you know get around things like when you're at your grandma's house and there's not as much as you know that your friends aren around to be active with or the girls hanging around and you know if you still want to be active how do you get around all that ?
106	t: i mean i just be like let's run form her or something because like sometimes like before we get ready to go outside she normally be like "oh let me go to the bathroom so i won have to use one while we're at the park" or whatever so i be like "let's just run let's just run to a certain like stink and then we can go the park for like five minutes" and then by the time we see her again we'll just run because like he live on as he live like four houses away from puritan and like i say like we run to like almost to 6 mile and then like we'll stop
313	c: so it buys you a little more time while she's trying to catch up and it's also that you're running around more with that
106	t: but like sometimes sometimes like right directly after school i go to my friend bernard house and i help him with his chores and then we get ready to leave back out go get our other friend from rechard he live closer to our school i think like probably a block or two away from bernard house and then we go back on 6th mile then we go play at the park
313	c: so again when you're at home with your friends you really are moving around to a lot of places when you get out and be with them because you're always traveling around and going from one place to another and you know walking and running when you're doing all that
117	t: yeah
331	c: well on a scale of like you know one to ten where one would be not at all important and ten would be very important like super super important how important is it for you to find ways to be active when you know you can play as much with your friends or you're at your grandma's ?
106	t: like it's important like like it's real important but like sometimes like running up and down her stairs she got like 17 stairs to get upstairs on the top floor so like running up and down the stairs that's still a good way to get active or like like sometimes she be like "go trim the bushes" or either right before she just got her lawnmower fixed she'd be like "go cut the grass" stuff like that
313	c: so she's giving you a lot a lot of chores to do around that keep you keep you moving
112	t: uh-huh and i'm going to have like more because i think for tenth grade i think i'm to live back with my grandma
311	c: uh-huh all right so that's going to kind of keep it going for a while
331	c: yeah so you said that it's important but what number would you put it on with that =
112	t: seven and a half
311	c: like a seven and a half
331	c: well what you know makes it a seven and a half and not like a ?
114	t: because like i like i feel the important as i feel that it is important to get active but then on the other hand i can because it's not that much to do and like i run around the corner over there but like her area is so bad like you run around the corner and you even say hi and then that take you to another way i'm going to have to blow your head off like somebody over there they just got robbed and shot like last week so like i just stay to myself over there
310	c: so safety's a pretty big issue so you're really thinking about the fact that you're kind of stuck when you're over there and you're not =
120	t: but like it's fun if you go there because like over at my house the only people that's around my age is bernard and rashad my friend tete he all right but like i love laughing and like sometimes he get on my nerves because he as i think he could be funny but like when he be making jokes he gotta put on like sound effect and all that into it so =
327	c: it's not your style you don think =
120	t: yeah so like and nicholas he all right but like if we go over and sit like his best friend house or my best friend house he'll be like "eewww why you hanging with ? but like he be playing but like inaudible on the other hand like you can say hi and he be like "why you talking to me about ? or like he gotta put all that extra stuff in it to make me not want to be around him
327	c: got a lot of attitude so so you're over there at your grandma's because you're kind of not with all those people and you're not really as annoyed but you at the same time =
120	t: like sometimes my friend bernard he do be getting on my nerves because like i could say something like i could be talking real fast and i could be like ahhhh like i just say something then he'll remix and then i'll be like "i didn say that" or like or like sometimes you just gotta laugh him off and then he'll be like "yeah thought you'd laugh"
327	c: so there's a lot going on with your friends over there and sometimes it's nice to =
120	t: but i also like being at my grandma's house because my mama she's not driving so therefore i see my grandma like i wouldn even say once a month like probably once every three months
327	c: if you're not staying there you don get to see her very often
117	t: yeah
310	c: so safety really and not really having stuff to do when you're over at your grandma's is one of the reasons that you know you're not necessarily a higher number on that importance thing
114	t: but then like at my house like like a boy that i don like to come in around about like 9:00 because then like i still want to run around and stuff so like at that time that's time for me to start wiring down but like i still want to be outside and stuff and like at that time everybody they gotta be on they block or something like close to somebody that they know because like over there's a lot of abandoned houses over there as my grandma like it's this abandoned house on the corner with the door kicked all the way in front door side door and back door and then it's another house that's burned down and then like two more houses down it's another house is burned down
325	c: so safety is also an issue kind of in your neighborhood it kind of cramps your style a bit because you'd like to be out later and running around and things so it's kind of the same not quite as bad as your gram's
331	c: then if you really were going to kind of bump yourself up to from like a seven and a half to like an eight and a half or a nine as far as importance to find activities that you could do at your grandma's or at home what would it take to bump you ?
106	t: like probably just i don know she make me do a lot for her so like running up and down the stairs washing the clothes go in the basement go put it inside the dryer and stuff so that's a lot
310	c: so you're pretty happy with the amount of activity that you're doing over there even though it's about 60% of what you're doing when you're home you're still pretty good with it
117	t: all right
327	c: you're the vip over ?
120	t: mm-mm that my friend all right
301	c: we don have a ton of time left just for like you and i to talk before we switch with your mom
302	c: and a lot of times when i meet with people we go ahead and write down a little bit of a plan in terms of what they'd like to do to kind of keep up with their you know or think about weight loss or work on it
306	c: what would you think about doing something like ?
112	t: like working on i mean it's all right
328	c: so we talked a lot today about really focusing on activity stuff you're doing at home and stuff you're doing at your grandma's and you know this idea about you you know are pretty active there are some things that kind of get in your way sometimes and you've noticed that being active actually really helped you with the weight loss
327	c: it's good to the last drop laughs
305	c: so what would you say that you know if you were to decide that you wanted to be more active or you wanted to do anything else for weight what would that thing ?
115	t: like it's nothing else to do so so like i think that's about it
325	c: what you're doing right now is is pretty much all that you could do there's nothing else left
313	c: so it's a matter of for you sticking with what you're already doing to kind of keep up with your weight loss that you're seeing and the clothes being looser and the fact that you're jumping higher and things
306	c: so what types of things with ?
301	c: let me grab a pen ? got it
120	t: write what my plan is and ?
305	c: again you don have to do it for me
333	c: so what have you got so ?
313	c: all right so you're saying that you want to make your activities more active
306	c: what do you mean by ?
106	t: like like make them more funner so like like find basically find more stuff to do
313	c: okay to kind of figure out what what you can do around that would be fun and then at your grandma's house do more stuff
106	t: mm-hmm like i probably going as like her yard is big so like probably run around her yard and stuff
313	c: all right so actually really thinking about like really specific things that you could do when you're there all right so you're really going for the weight loss idea
333	c: anything ?
344	c: well what are some things that could get in the way of being active or you know running around your grandma's yard =
109	t: if i get sick or something
344	c: all right what ?
109	t: like if i get sick or like if i gotta do something like if i gotta  probably as i don know
326	c: just stuff life happens have to do other things
333	c: so if you if you get sick how do you as what can you do to still stick with your ?
106	t: like probably play until i get like as normally when i get sick i get sick and then like like the sickness wear down so i could probably like play a little and then like if i start feeling sick again like probably just lay right down or something
313	c: okay so kind of test it out
117	t: mm-hmm
344	c: and then what about if you have other stuff to do that will keep you being less ?
106	t: like when i get when i get done doing that i just have to make up the time from when i wasn
308	c: ooh man so you're really kind of thinking about in like the overall part of your day planning stuff out and taking care of business
305	c: any of that you wanted to write ?
120	t: can you spell ? i know it's e-x
330	c: mm-hmm e-r-i-s-e
308	c: great all right so really thinking about really specific things that you could do around as far as like your first step in order to find more fun activities and do more with the exercising riding a bike
331	c: well what's something that your mom can do to help you to reach this ?
115	t: like i don know 'cause she do a lot of walking and sometimes i don be wanting to go so i can really blame her so
311	c: so she sets a pretty good example with activity she's pretty active person
109	t: like she play with my sister and walk around and all of that extra stuff like she do she be doing too much so i try inaudible
325	c: right 'cause it's not really as it's a little bit too much for you actually the amount of activity she's doing so actually hanging with her walking with her isn something that you want to do
331	c: but what is something that she could do to help you reach your goal of being more active and finding something to do while at your ?
109	t: i don know 'cause she don go over there that much so
