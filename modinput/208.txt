301	c: ? okay justin ?
117	t: mm-hmm
343	c: okay so tell me a little bit about sort of where you're at you know with your weight and what brought you here today
106	t: better than what i started when i was 180 pounds and i'm in the70s trying to get to the 60s and the 50s i feel good about myself now i kind of didn feel comfortable when i was 180 pounds but now that i i got a little smaller and i'm starting to lose some weight i'm feeling better
313	c: okay so you've already made a lot of changes it sounds like that got you from in the 80s to the 70s and you feel pretty confident now about things you've also mentioned feeling better
333	c: tell me more about that
106	t: i feel better because like i knew with my like when i'm like when i was 180 pounds i wasn i didn want to do anything like i just want to stay home play video games or like when i went to the gym just sit around something like that but now i feel better where like i know that i could lose weight and it pushes me a little bit more to like instead of going instead of playing that video game go outside or instead of just sitting around play basketball with my friends or something like that
311	c: so it sounds like you feel better sort of emotionally fell more confident feel like you can do it and you feel better physically maybe more energy getting outside more instead of laying around more so you've already noticed a fair a lot of positives from losing
333	c: and what did you do that got you already you know to kind of get the process ?
106	t: one me and my mom we changed our food habit completely like we cook pancakes and sausage or something like that but instead now we make every other day we will make smoothie with two two vegetable-two to three fruits and one to two vegetables and if like the smoothie if we don really like the smoothie we add a little bit of splenda and then we will either have-and then we'll have some kind of carbohydrate like a piece of whole grain bread with like splenda and a inaudible substitute and then a fruit
313	c: okay so you kind of came up with a very specific change in terms of breakfast and before you used to have pancakes and sausage a lot of the time and now every other day you do a smoothie and a whole grain carbohydrate
106	t: well like i used to we used to like live in fast food restaurants but my mom figured out that like you really can just say we can go to the fast food restaurants so like maybe every saturday we'll just go to like a restaurant for dinner or lunch and just get like just splurge a little bit
314	c: so you used to live at fast food like you ate it all the time
106	t: right we could eat like three times a week and it really helped that now i can just like like go into burger king or something and get some chicken on a saturday and then be okay with it
305	c: okay so one of the things you've noticed is that you have to cut back on fast food but to quit completely doesn work for you and to know that you have one day a week where you can kind of go as a treat
112	t: and i'm really glad that my mom realized that
311	c: okay so she made some changes too that instead of kind of going all or nothing she's kind of
120	t: it's been really hard for her laughs like my mom she own a cheesecake bakery
345	c: she does ?
120	t: owns a cheesecake
327	c: oh she owns a cheesecake bakery
120	t: and like we like our business-because i'm in it too i help her like it's not really it's really not been that good because our recession but my mom has been making cheesecakes for like my aunt because i have 12 aunts and uncles for their birthdays for my dad my grandparents so something like that but we like she sometimes eat a lot like it's only one thing i relay can-because i got my mom off of pepsi to diet pepsi which is a big change because i didn think that was going to happen but it's like it's a soft peppermint that you can get at like rite aid and cvs that she's
328	c: she's addicted to soft peppermints so you both are struggling with figuring out like food and health and you've helped each other she helped you with the breakfast sound like you helped her with the pepsi cheesecakes are hard because they're around all the time so there's a lot of things you have to watch
120	t: don tell her i told you this but on father's day my dad caught-he was at work he asked her could "could you make me the caramel apple" because that was his favorite flavor she ate his whole-well like maybe 3/4 of his whole first cake and then made him another
327	c: oh no oh no so she's struggling with the cheesecake and she even ate the cake was supposed to be for him and had to make him another one
120	t: but i'm surprised though she's been doing real good but like it's cake she usually get out at the gas station she won even-like she'll go in the gas station won even think about them just get something good to eat
330	c: okay
112	t: i'm really proud of my mom because she's pushing me and encouraging me
311	c: so you're proud of your mom for her own behavior and you like how she's encouraging you yeah well it sounds like you guys are pretty tight right now and that you feel good about where things are going
106	t: she's helping she's helping me a lot like not only with my health but like this morning like we our church is in a big church called our church is precious spirit and it's in a big community called vision 2000 and they own like eight churches and this saturday we're going on a picnic and at a water park i wasn going to go swimming because i don want no inaudible because i didn want nobody to see my stomach she encouraged me that okay it's all right it's like it's not-it's like it's whole bunch of people that's bigger than you and you should be okay with your weight though and i think i'm going swimming now
313	c: so you're going to go so you were almost going to stop doing something that was fun and something that was also healthy right because going water park swimming's physical
112	t: like i would really-because i know my mom and my nephew that was going to go like he's the one that i would have-because she probably wanted to help him with something i probably would have to play with him in the water park and i really wasn going to go and i could have ruined his time
328	c: so it would have affected a lot of people but your health especially and now you decided-she gave you she kind of helped you say "you know what i'm okay with this and i'm going to go have fun and do what's good for me" and the swimming is good for you health-wise so you've talked about a couple of things already that you're doing in terms of -it sounds like you're pretty motivated to continue this process and you've talked about food changes like with breakfast and fast food you've talked about being more physical with playing outside with your friends and doing less video games what if anything would you like to kind of add to that ?
305	c: t: i don like i don like to go-because sometimes my mom she has a herniated disc in her back and some morning she just can get up and walk around walk around the track and play maybe play basketball but i wish it was some way she could do it but i understand if she can like it's some days that her back do sincerely be hurting but others she might just not want to get up
109	t: c: so you it sounds like you'd like to go to the track and play basketball
311	c: and you'd like your mom to come with you but you're not sure if she can
117	t: yeah
331	c: okay and tell me more about you wanting to do that
112	t: well i do not like walking around the track sometimes so what i did was i took my psp and i noticed that if you just like play and then you just start walking and you really don think about it like i just think about the
333	c: you can walk and play at the same ?
112	t: yeah you can walk and play at the same time so i be sitting walking there and then after a while you realize that you might have walked around like three times
311	c: right it's kind of like the way people like watch tv while they're on the exercise bike or whatever that same concept
112	t: yeah like sometimes i'm not like maybe she-like sometimes she do want to get up and go to the track but i might be tired we just gotta really figure out something where we like maybe make a list like what days we can get up and walk around the track
311	c: okay so one change you'd like to make is a more kind of structured plan to get to the track
331	c: and with her are you allowed-i'm wondering what is it like to go without ? is that an option or not an ?
106	t: like she's very protective of me and it's kind of like sometimes i like-she won even let me-me and her be in the car me and her and my daddy be in the car and it might be getting dark and we pull up to the gas station my dad be like "go ahead and get us pop out of there"-and my mom just like "no no you go in and get it" like she's kind of protective of me and i understand why though because i'm her only-like i'm basically her only child my sister's 24 lives in taylor but i i wouldn mind because like my friends like i have one friend he's not that big he's like 140 i think and he gets up and me him and his brother we have like a little lawn mowing service where we go walk about four or five blocks and see if anybody wants their lawn mowed and we try to do that start with that
310	c: so you-so one of the reasons she may not be thrilled about you going alone is because she tends to be pretty protective and yet with this lawn service you're getting a little bit more freedom so maybe you could talk about it with her and kind of see where it's at
109	t: because inaudible like even if we like if we have a nice big yard that we have to cut and it's about 6:30 i can do it i have to go home because she's like you have to get home by 6 7 o'clock and i'm like okay but like most people that's when they'll let us cut the grass and that's like i'm not getting getting any money and plus i'm not getting that much exercise so i have to go home
328	c: okay so there's two areas that you would like to be more active in one is the track in the morning and the other is being able to cut lawns a little bit later in the evening
305	c: which of these or both of them do you want to bring up potentially you know with ?
112	t: i would say jogging but lawn mowing 'cause the thing is like we don like lawn mowing in the sun like 3:00
312	c: baking on you
109	t: we will do it but we don like we like to-and that's when i don really go out because like the sun at when i'm sweating it makes my skin dry up and get really dirty and everything it's like hard to get off my face but i will do it it's just sometimes my mom either if if it's not me saying i don want to go outside it's too hot the heat's like crazy outside it's either like she doesn want me to go outside
310	c: okay so doing the lawn mowing in the afternoon isn a great option and so you could talk to her about going a little bit later but maybe before dark but later or something like that
117	t: yeah
328	c: okay so i'm wondering you know one of the things-you've come up with a couple of those i mean obviously you're doing some things like the breakfast and stuff that you'd like to continue doing but the specific goal that it sounds like you want to add today is making a plan for track in the morning and you can bring up the lawn mowing thing also but the track in the morning is something that's really you know that you want to do
302	c: and so some people find it helpful to write it down on a piece of paper their goal and other kids don think that's necessary
305	c: what would you like to ?
117	t: uh
302	c: this is just like what your plan is what you want to do what might get in the way and kind of figuring that out
112	t: i'm not sure laughs i think i can do that
333	c: the ?
117	t: mm-hmm
305	c: okay so we can do it together if you want okay so your plan is ?
106	t: to get outside more and jog
313	c: okay so go to the track in the morning
328	c: now you've said two different things you've said walk with the psp and you said jog
302	c: are those-i'm not sure if jogging with the psp is an option laughs
106	t: oh yeah it's like if-see when you have a psp basically all you do is look at the screen and walk so and i walk around the track and i'm like basically i'm not focusing on my walking i'm focusing on my psp
311	c: and you can jog too it's the same thing okay
106	t: i have to walk
313	c: okay so your plan is to go to the track in the morning
331	c: and why do you want to do ?
112	t: to get healthier and lose some weight
311	c: okay all right you really want to increase the morning activity to get healthy
308	c: and continue the great stuff that you've already been doing
344	c: and what might get in the ?
109	t: my mom's herniated disc
326	c: okay your mom not wanting to-either wanting to get going or really not being able to get going
120	t: i don really know how to spell herniated disc
327	c: don worry maybe something
120	t: i'll just put back problem
329	c: okay laughs i'm not sure i could help you with the spelling
333	c: and what could you try to kind of get over that obstacle
106	t: jog with a friend
308	c: okay that's a great idea having a friend to go with you so that she wouldn be as nervous about you going by yourself
112	t: because my best friends they like my friends i'm not really an early person-well i can get up early and that's when they go lawn go to start mowing lawns because they have a few we have a few regulars
331	c: so would you-is it realistic that you could find someone to go with you in the ?
112	t: yeah i could jog with one of them because like my friend malik and brandon he like we and malik we don really go in the morning because we be asleep i think malik will get up and go walk around the track
310	c: okay so if you made a plan you know really planned it out that's something that you think he could do and you'd have to kind of give him a call like maybe that day or something and it would work for you
305	c: okay and what's the first thing you can do to reach this goal you know like when you're leaving here today what could you ? assuming that your mom's onboard
112	t: i could make a list that like would help me-like i think that if my mom took her pain pills maybe at night it would help her where she doesn feel that much pain in the morning and she might be able to get up in the morning and jog
328	c: okay so maybe reminding your mom about the pain pills she might be more likely to in the morning and that's something you could do now and you also mentioned giving your friends a call you know maybe the night before and making a plan and that's something that you could do today if you wanted
306	c: anything else that you can think of that would ?
117	t: i think that's it
328	c: okay all right so you've mentioned already that you've made a lot of changes already that have really been working out for you you feel really good about it and this is maybe a good time to kind of kick it up a notch because you want to get to the 70s and the 60s and you've identified a couple specific things
301	c: i'm going to meet with your mom alone next so you have there are a couple options i could share this with her directly i could maybe just talk it over with her a little ?
119	t: talk it over
305	c: sounds like you feel more comfortable with that okay then why don i give this to you and you can do fold it up you can put it away whatever you want to do with it
301	c: and then i'll talk with your mom and then what i'll ask you know when you come back together is to share your goal not the paper exactly but maybe more the goal in general
306	c: that sound like a reasonable plan to ?
120	t: can i ask you a ? on the survey it was a part that said do you have a dog and i don but like my godfamily live right next to us and like they go to work in the morning and i'll go over and maybe water give the dog some food because we have dog food at our house for the dog
327	c: uh-huh it's like almost like your dog like your foster dog laughs
120	t: yeah inaudible basically like dogsit and wash the dog off no maybe twice a week
301	c: okay so i think you probably then answered it the best you could sounds like okay i'm going to go get your mom and then they're going to do some things and then we'll get back together inaudible
