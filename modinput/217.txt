106	t: yeah it's kind of hard but yes but i'm trying they said i have to get down to 160 or i don make the team so i'm trying to lose it
313	c: you really have a goal in mind so that you can keep playing even though it can be tough some days you're really sticking with it
331	c: well how come you decided to stay with it and really keep working towards that ?
112	t: because like it's important for me because i don want to give up or nothing so i just want to make i want to make the team because i'm i'm good at football you know and i don want to i don want that to be thrown away if i don make the team so
311	c: yeah it's something you're good at and you want to keep doing it
308	c: alright cool so you really have been doing a great job with keeping with the activity and and doing the the stuff with the football so it sounds like you're a pretty active person
106	t: my coach said like oh man my weight they said like i'm real fast like from all it because we do we do some drills like offense drills and it's like i play wide receiver or something and then yesterday like i could catch the ball without anybody trying to take it from me
310	c: hmm so you've got the moves too and they're really impressed with what you can do at your size and thinking that if you lose some weight you'll really improve too so that's going really well
117	t: mm-hmm
328	c: so you do a lot it sounds you know with the the football practice and stuff you're doing at home you've been doing high knees at home and the pushups and things
302	c: and one of the things that a lot of times i talk about with people is is activity or i talk about food and and the eating part of things
306	c: what would you like to focus our our little time on here ?
109	t: i really can say really i can
307	c: it's kind of hard to make a decision between talking about making food changes or sticking with that activity stuff that you're doing already
119	t: yeah i inaudible and they're it's like you try and lose weight like because he's at like 200 and something and he's starting to lose it like a little bit and like at my school like we got like popular kids but i'm one of them but so we you would think we'd make fun but we don like we just let them we we're friends with him now so if anybody if anybody like messes with him it's like they're messing with us so it's like best friends like
327	c: mm-hmm so you're really protecting other people that have weight problems and really looking out for them i bet he appreciates that a lot so you're kind of aware of the fact that people can be kind of mean
119	t: it's like i mean it's like he doesn he's not emotional or nothing he's just like he just he'll attack them back and talk about it but then like we'll get up there because like some of my friends like they're not overweight so you know
327	c: so you guys could really protect him and you're really a member of the group and so people don bother you about it but you're there to kind of help other people get through it and you can see how hard he's working on losing weight
309	c: well you're a good friend to him
117	t: thank you
328	c: you're looking out so he's working pretty hard on on his weight and then it sounds like you're working really hard on your weight too with all the football things that you're doing
117	t: yes
305	c: and there there might be some food things that you're thinking about doing too
106	t: like i really don now i really don use a lot of salt now i don use a lot of sugar now really i i really i'm going to tell you like all i drink all day is gatorade or water or i'm not my mom just makes something but it's not like unhealthy
313	c: so you do you know you do some things to keep your eating smart so that you're staying on track with all the activity that you're doing
117	t: yeah
305	c: well good and so you're feeling pretty good about what you're doing with the food stuff not really something that you want to talk about today or anything about like eating out in restaurants or watching portion sizes
106	t: really i mean i don we don really go to fast food restaurants we only go there once a week but we don get i don get a lot of big stuff like just mcdonald's i mean i just get a grilled chicken sandwich or something from there it's good so
313	c: so you're really making healthy choices there too wow so this whole idea of the weight loss it's not just coming from all the football practice and the activity
309	c: but you're also doing smart stuff with your eating
117	t: yeah
310	c: okay so that's really the healthy way to go about losing weight kind of maintain it
308	c: yeah well i've got to say you're a pretty smart guy mm-hmm so you have been doing some great stuff
117	t: mm-hmm
311	c: and you said it's it's important to you really to work towards that goal for football
120	t: yes it is
305	c: so what what do you really want to focus on in order to keep on track with your weight ?
112	t: i just just i just need to exercise more and eat like more vegetables and stuff i don really eat a lot of vegetables i eat some but i don eat a lot so yeah
311	c: so again you're going back to both sides of the weight loss thing keeping up with your activity and thinking about bringing in some more vegetables
117	t: yeah
305	c: alright cool well would you want to make a kind of a little plan about something like ?
118	t: not it's i don kind of i don know
325	c: it's a little you're not really you're kind of on the fence as far as like writing things down or or doing it that way
117	t: yeah
305	c: alright well you know this really is kind of your session so if it's not something that you want to do or you know do or don want to do we don have to worry about it just to kind of you know if it's okay with you i'll just show this to you and then if it doesn sound like something you want to do then we can kind of you know talk about something else but it just gives you a chance to kind of see you know if you were going to keep up with that or make food stuff like you were talking about with the vegetables a little chance to to write down a plan and if it seems like it's not really the right time for you then we don have to do it but if you want to take a stab at it we can
118	t: hmm
312	c: no you're not really interested in doing this right now
118	t: no not really
329	c: okay i'm just going to slide it down alright
328	c: no problem okay so already so much great stuff with losing the six pounds with both you know all the exercise you're doing with the football and you mentioned some stuff with eating more vegetables
117	t: mm-hmm
343	c: tell me a little bit more about that
114	t: i'm not really a vegetable person i might eat a salad but i don i don really go and eat i'll eat more fruit than i do vegetables like i don like vegetables like because they don taste that great to me i really prefer i used to eat like nectarines and watermelon and grapes and that's it and sometimes orange juice but vegetables it's not that good
313	c: so you're eating a lot of really healthy things as far as the fruit goes giving your body all that good vitamins and minerals you need to kind of grow stronger and build your muscles for football and you're also hearing that vegetables are an important part of that too alright well who's kind of saying you know "you need to eat more ?
331	c:
112	t: not really anybody i just need to eat to me in my mind i need to eat some more yeah
305	c: so it's coming from you like nobody's standing over there as you're eating saying like "peter eat these" you're kind of saying you know for me i want to eat more veggies
117	t: yeah
331	c: why would you want to eat up more of the ? okay why would you want to eat more ?
112	t: i mean it could still help me out like you know just help my health and stuff yeah
311	c: so the whole idea that you know you've heard vegetables are a healthy food and you're a healthy guy and are working towards that goal of football so you want to add some more in
117	t: yeah
333	c: well if you were going to add in some more vegetables how would you do ?
120	t: hmm you want explain that question inaudible
329	c: mm-hmm i wasn really clear on my question
117	t: uh-uh
333	c: sorry about that well if you were going to say like alright today i'm going to eat another vegetable how how would you do that or when when would you do ?
109	t: hmm i really can say i'm not sure
326	c: so you have in your mind this idea that maybe you'd like to eat some more vegetables but you're not quite sure how to add them in
117	t: yeah
307	c: yeah it's not something you've really you know thought about before and that's really fair i mean i can tell that this is a new thing for you
311	c: you're thinking about making a little change in your eating
331	c: so nice well if you you know if you wanted to eat some more vegetables you know who's somebody that could help you you know figure out how to put that in your ?
112	t: probably my great-grandma like well she plants vegetables and stuff and she saves them so she probably could she might she cooks vegetables and inaudible
311	c: so somebody in your family has the garden and makes vegetables already and you can talk to her about it
331	c: so you know there's one idea what else or who else would you talk to about ?
109	t: i really can even say nobody else i don think
312	c: so other members of your family really don eat a lot of vegetables
112	t: i mean some but not a lot not a lot of my family members but some do
311	c: so you are actually kind of thinking about eating more vegetables than a lot of your family does for your your health goals and your weight loss
328	c: yeah well and you kind of said that you just want to be healthy and you you know working working towards having the vegetables
326	c: and your grandma's the one person that you can talk to about that so you're doing great things with the football keeping up with those practices and our again you know also talking about some more of the vegetables you're just not quite sure how you would get that into your day you know i have some ideas on some stuff that works for other people
302	c: would you want to hear some of ?
117	t: yeah
302	c: well sometimes people will add in just one vegetable to whatever meal they're having like their lunch or dinner just to kind of start slow so they might add things in like you know a salad or or cut up carrots or other vegetables that they that they like to eat
305	c: how would that work for ?
112	t: it would work good i could do it
311	c: so that sounds something that's pretty reasonable for you
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: tell me what kind of veggies you like to eat
112	t: hmm i like i think banana peppers or something like that i like jalapenos and carrots they're alright
311	c: so you've got some definitely on the list
112	t: broccoli's cool too so
308	c: you're adding more and more as we go here it's impressive that you have a pretty wide range of veggies that you like
302	c: you know it sounds like some information about how people add vegetables into their their diet might be helpful
305	c: but maybe not maybe you already have some ideas on on what you want to do
117	t: mm-hmm hmm
302	c: so you have some ideas well if you'd like when kind of like we'll we'll after we switch places and things i can get a little handout that gives some ideas for people on how they add vegetables into their diet and we can take a a look at that with your mom
117	t: okay
305	c: that would be something that might sound good to ?
117	t: mm-hmm
328	c: okay great so adding some veggies in is something you're thinking about you're willing to take a look at a handout that talks about that and you've been just totally doing great with the football stuff it's you know important to you to kind of stick with that because you're really good at it and it's fun
117	t: yeah
305	c: so as far as what we talked about today like those things with the veggies and stuff how how can i kind of share that with your ?
112	t: i can really explain like i mean my mom she can cook vegetables like she cooks chicken and spinach something like that she cooks that and that's all i can think of now
311	c: so she's cooking some vegetables
301	c: yeah and it's alright with you if i if i talk to her about the vegetables that you're thinking about adding in alright great well in that case unless you have anything else that you want to talk about as far as the weight loss goes we can go ahead and switch places ? okay here you go come on out we'll see what toya and tamara have we'll go out to the waiting room here and see
