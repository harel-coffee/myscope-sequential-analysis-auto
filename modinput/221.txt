301	c: so you got through all the questionnaires and all that kind of good stuff ?
117	t: yeah
301	c: great i just want to let you know that this is the part where like you talked about with sarah and toya i'm actually going to turn the cameras on and make sure that's okay with you
117	t: yeah
327	c: okay so you're feeling pretty good about that not a problem
117	t: yeah
301	c: and i just want to kind of let you know that as far as what we're going to do here today we'll get a chance to talk about some things related to weight loss like nutrition and activity
305	c: and it's really not my job to tell you what to do i don know if you've met someone to talk about this kind of stuff before but a lot of times telling people what to do isn really helpful so i'm just going to see if there's anything that you know what your ideas are and what you might want to work on
117	t: yeah
306	c: okay so all that sounds pretty okay with ?
117	t: yeah
327	c: okay good actually you're not too shabby ?
117	t: i guess
301	c: okay alright well we'll give you that but i also want to let you know everything you say in here is confidential unless you let me know you're going to hurt yourself or somebody else or there's a child or elderly person in danger alright so otherwise we're just mainly taping this so we can learn how to talk to people the best way about weight loss
117	t: right
343	c: cool so now that that stuff's all out of the way so how do you feel about your ?
115	t: i'm kind of all right it's like i want to get it off me but don want to
325	c: so you're not really sure what you want to do with your weight right ?
117	t: yeah
117	t: yes
331	c: what kinds of things have you ?
112	t: well since i have diabetes now asthma reflux and stuff with all this weight on me i could possibly die i could pass out anything basically can happen and one of them say they had got me when they say i could die i'm like "whoa" i'm trying to do something about it but i'm not trying enough that's what everybody else is saying i'm trying but they say i'm not so it's really like okay just try harder
311	c: so there's a lot going on
117	t: yeah
307	c: it's pretty scary
117	t: yeah
333	c: and it sounds like you are doing some things to work on your weight
103	t: yeah i'm trying here and there like i'm drinking instead of drinking pop like if i can i'll buy me a flavored water or something that's a little bit healthier than drinking pop but sometimes my instincts say go do what i want to do and have to have that pop so i need to get a need to get control over these instincts and try to drink at least something healthy
313	c: right so really for you making changes in what you're drinking is something that you're working on for your ?
117	t: yeah yeah
311	c: so you mentioned that getting a way to kind of get control of those instincts
117	t: yeah
332	c: you know tell me a little bit more about what goes on when you mean with the instincts
103	t: like say if you put water flavored water and then pop on a table and you say "choose one" my instincts will tell me to go for the pop but what i'm thinking wants to go to either the flavored water or the water and my instincts most of the times take over and i grab the pop so or like if you put vegetables fruit and fried food my instincts may tell me go for the vegetables but i'm looking at the fried food like okay little bit tastier or healthier and i try my best to go for the fruit cause actually i like fruit but when i see foods that i know i like it's kind of hard to keep it on the fruit
307	c: so again not only are you coming in here to talk to me having had some experience with working on your weight you're really thinking about you know that idea of sometimes when you're in the moment you know it's tough you know what it feels like to have to make a choice about the food
117	t: yeah
313	c: and you're really working on how to make those choices healthier more often than not
117	t: yeah
308	c: wow that's some serious thought about the weight
117	t: yeah
311	c: so you know it sounds pretty important that you do want to take some weight off and you know make healthier choices
117	t: yeah
313	c: so you're doing a lot with thinking about the foods
331	c: and when you are you know like say you have the water or you have the pop in front of you what would be some of the good things to choose the pop i'm sorry to choose the water instead of the ?
311	c: okay alright so you're really are pretty aware of the reasons that water's healthier
308	c: i mean you know you're a smart guy and people have been talking to you a lot about your health
117	t: yeah
314	c: you're hearing the stuff but you're still choosing the pop
117	t: yeah
305	c: well you know when you came in here i kind of mentioned that you have the chance to say what you'd like to talk about more and i get the feeling that for you you kind of said pop is one thing that you're working on choosing less but you're not really sure if you want to do it more often or not
103	t: well if i can cut down on the pop like cause my mom's cooking more healthier stuff but then it's the thing of me overeating it still and that's what's basically happening like my mom cooks healthy i'm still trying to drink the pop but then i overeat on the healthy food then i really don like really count whether it's healthy or not cause inaudible
328	c: so you're kind of catching yourself with the portions too you're choosing healthy foods your mom's you know cooking them for you she's cooking healthier
117	t: yeah
308	c: hmm so you again have you know you have a lot of ideas and actually you know quite a bit i mean it's not like i need to sit here and kind of say to you "well let's have a nutrition class and this is what people need to do to lose weight" you know a lot about that stuff
117	t: yeah yeah
331	c: so when you think about kind of choosing you know you talked about some of the things that your instincts have you choose the pop instead of like the water even though you know you have a lot of really good reasons for drinking water the pop is tasting better
112	t: when basically one doctor's already told me that all the weight just making my illnesses worser and have more inaudible to open my body and putting stress on different parts of my body and stuff
307	c: so it's really coming back to your health and how scary it is to think about what's going on right now in your ?
117	t: yeah yeah
331	c: so what would it take for you to say "okay you know i'm going to choose water instead of ?
117	t: i don know
312	c: you're kind of at a point where you're not quite sure yet
332	c: hmm well tell me in about you know maybe five years from now what do you see happening if you don make any changes in your eating or what you're ?
307	c: so a lot of really you know scary stuff again
117	t: yeah
305	c: </sample>
112	t: yeah it's depressing at times and then at other times like i'm getting over it basically like finding ways to take my mind off of it get happier and stuff but still always there and you're thinking about it even though you're having fun you still thinking about them
311	c: so it's kind of something that's always bugging ?
117	t: yeah
307	c: and making the decision to really do something about it like change what you're drinking or eat smaller portions like you talked about is a tough thing to do
117	t: yeah
331	c: well on a scale of one to ten where one would be like not at all important and ten would be very important how important would you say it is for you to make a change in either your portions or what you're ?
112	t: i would give it like a five or a six
311	c: so it's in the important ?
117	t: yeah
331	c: alright so what made you say a five or a six instead of like a three or a ?
112	t: because i think i pretty much want to go for the change but it's going to take something to get me up to a ten that makes me want to change fully
311	c: okay so something is going to you know you've got some reasons in there but you really have like this what is going to be to get you ?
117	t: yeah
331	c: well tell me what would it take to get you up to a little bit higher not necessarily a ten even though that's a great place to go if you want to but what would it take to bump you up to maybe like a seven or an eight in how important it is for you to change your eating and ?
112	t: probably probably for something something that really bad happen dealing with bad foods and pop and stuff it'd have to be something really bad to happen like somebody in my family dies from it or some something has to happen i just don know yet
311	c: so it's got to be something ?
117	t: yeah
328	c: alright well so we've had some time to kind of talk a lot about you know nutrition and you've come up with some ideas as far as the drinking and changing portions but you're not quite sure about what you know what you want to do or what the thing is going to be that's going to get you work on that a little bit more
117	t: yeah
302	c: and you know sometimes when i meet with people we kind of write down a plan cause that's helpful for people to kind of remember what they're thinking about working on and sometimes that plan is what they want to do or sometimes it's what they want to think about doing
305	c: so you know if you had to pick something that you want to work on for your weight loss or think about working on what would that thing ?
112	t: food i would guess cutting down on portions
311	c: alright so you're you know going back to that whole idea of portions
117	t: yeah
312	c: yeah but you're almost not quite sure how you would do that or you know like if you when you go home today what you would do with that information
117	t: yeah
332	c: yeah so making that kind of a plan might not be very helpful for ?
117	t: probably not
331	c: okay well what would be something that would be helpful for you when you leave here today to work or think about working on your weight ?
112	t: at least probably like some probably some kind of motivation something that would really like make somebody happy to eat smaller portions stop drinking pop i don know
311	c: so you're looking for like the actual like the ?
112	t: yeah basically the thing that will pump me up and say "okay this is i'm going to do this and it's going to be right now" basically
311	c: so you want that like "alright this is my starting point this is why i want to do this this is what i want to do"
117	t: yeah
331	c: so what is that thing for ?
117	t: i don know
311	c: figuring out what that thing is would really put you at the point of getting toward starting that ?
112	t: yeah i believe so
311	c: well what's you know now you're here with your mom today
117	t: yeah
331	c: but you know what's something that she could do to help you with your ?
109	t: i really don know i really ain no answer for that one it's real hard to answer that one cause i don i can really think of nothing that she ain doing already that could help me that could motivate me so
311	c: yeah so she's doing a lot of stuff
117	t: yeah
308	c: and you know it takes a lot of courage for you to come in here and talk to me about losing weight and share with me the stuff that you know the doctor's telling you about getting sick or even dying
312	c: so it's really showing that weight loss to you is something that's important but you're not really quite confident about how to go about doing it yet
117	t: yeah
311	c: oops sorry about that so you have some thoughts that really building your confidence
117	t: yeah
345	c: is one way that you could go well what's something that you've done in the past when you didn think you could do it that you were able to ? like something in school or something with your family
120	t: i didn think i could i didn think i could really possibly like try to make a relationship with my dad's side of the family because it was like before he died it was like i never really knew nobody on his side and once he had died it was like "okay now is the time for me to step up and try to make a relationship" and i'm actually starting to do it and pushing people to basically like "come on let's go do something fun let's hang out let's spend time" it got kind of hard but i'm still working on it
308	c: ahh you're really taking a strong role in the family
117	t: yeah
327	c: and even though it's not the easiest thing to do it's so important to you that you're going to keep pushing on people and keep getting them out there and you're getting to know them
117	t: yeah
308	c: so when you set your mind to things you're able to make stuff happen
120	t: yeah sometimes
327	c: so it doesn always work but you definitely know one spot in your life where it is working
117	t: yeah
331	c: well how would that kind of determination of getting to know your dad's side of the family help you with your changes in your eating and ?
120	t: well on my dad's side of the family i really couldn think of nothing that that side of the family of my family could help me with so
312	c: so when you think of the people themselves they're not very much help with ?
109	t: they are helpful they're just like they keep helping me and stuff but i don i really can think of nothing they could do to help me
312	c: alright so they're doing some healthy things but in terms of helping you with your weight you're not really you can think of ?
117	t: no
327	c: but when you think about how determined you are to get to know them and how you have to kind of keep on calling them and organize a lot of the stuff that takes a lot of your time and your effort and it sounds like sometimes they don always cooperate and you still have to keep kind of pushing and working at ?
117	t: yeah
331	c: yeah so how does that kind of feeling that you know keeping the push on something and working on it and working towards a goal how can that help you when you think about doing things for weight ?
112	t: well it could help me a lot if i like really set my mind down deep into it and push and push and push until i finally just break through it and be there and be like okay this is what i'm going to do right now i'm going to go healthy i'm going to stop drinking pop eat smaller portions lose this weight
311	c: so it's in there
112	t: yeah it's in there
311	c: the determination cause just like you did with your family you've got the strength to make things happen when you decide that you want to do it
117	t: yeah
328	c: all right cool well it sounds like you're kind of at a point where you're still deciding what you want to do and you've got some ideas as far as the eating and you know drinking of different things
301	c: and if it's okay with you i'll have you switch places with your mom now so that i'll have a chance to kind of talk with her a little bit and you mentioned that she's being really supportive and you can think of anything that she could do different to help you stay ?
117	t: mm-hmm
306	c: what else am i missing from what we talked about that you would want to share with your ?
112	t: mmm nothing really i think you basically like hit the major points of what we was talking about so i'll say that what you said is really like all we need to talk with her about
311	c: okay so i covered all the you know the main ?
117	t: yeah
301	c: alright great and if it's alright with you when we come back in you know you'll get to share that kind of stuff with her
