345	c: how are ?
117	t: fine
301	c: ? alright well we're going to go ahead and get started with that part where they turn on the cameras
306	c: and i just want to double check with you that that's okay and you're feeling okay with that
117	t: yeah
301	c: alright and just to let you know everything you say in here is confidential unless you let me know you're going to hurt yourself or somebody else or there's a child or elderly person in trouble okay
306	c: so no problems with all that ?
120	t: nothing like that
301	c: okay so today we'll have a chance to talk about some nutrition and activity things related to to weight loss if you like and i spent a little bit of time you know we talk together and then i'll talk with your mom and then we'll kind of come back in together at the end
117	t: okay
305	c: so you know again everything seems pretty fair so far well my job here is not to tell you what to do alright and that's kind of a relief laughs because a lot of times telling people what to do isn very helpful to them and so it's really just my job to just see if there's anything i can do that's around that might help you with different goals that you might have
117	t: okay
301	c: okay good alright so you're in here and you made it through all the paperwork and all that kind of stuff
117	t: yeah
343	c: and all that so tell me you know how do you feel about your ?
112	t: i feel like i could knock down a few pounds because like last year i wasn as big but then i just started eating and eating and then i started gaining pounds because my uncle said the same thing he was like i don he was like "you're getting kind of big" i was like "i know" because i eat a lot yeah i just gain pounds because like last year i think i was like 120-something and then i'm like 213
311	c: so you've noticed a difference in your weight
117	t: yep
305	c: so one option for you in order to think about losing weight might be to talk about how much you're eating
103	t: i eat a lot of junk food like cake and cookies stuff like that
311	c: so you actually have an idea already about what you're doing right now that kind of might be linked to to the weight that you've gained
112	t: yeah i it was a class at this center it's called inaudible center and they had said i could come up there to do the exercise at the pool it's like they teach they do the aerobics and stuff and they got like a gym that you can play in to you know and an exercise room like treadmills and weights and stuff they told me i could come in there anytime so yeah
311	c: so you found a place that you can do activity if you wanted to
112	t: yeah it's only like right up the street from me
305	c: and it's nice and close by so you're feeling kind of excited that that's an option for you if you want to do it
112	t: yep and there's like a right down the street from me like a mile down is like an exercise place where there's like a lot of people be there it be packed laughs a lot of people be there because like mostly it's like a fitness room and everybody be there
311	c: so not only you'd get some activity and you'd see a lot of people that were up there
117	t: yeah
313	c: well it sounds like you've you know put some effort into number one kind of thinking about what you're doing right now in terms of eating and also finding ways to be active already so that you know doing that stuff and losing weight is something you've kind of been thinking about already
103	t: like i'll be thinking like i should slow up the eating but then like when we order pizza i'll be like okay this is pizza i'm ready to eat and then i'm thinking like you know go back and i'm like there's pizza right there so i just be eating
326	c: so in your mind you're saying okay you know i'm going to stop eating as much cut down a little bit still eat the foods that i'm enjoying but not as much and then when it's in front of you it's pretty hard to do
119	t: yeah so my mama been she had a dietitian too to go to but i don think she go to it anymore but yeah she's her weight coming down hers been coming down but mine's been going up laughs because she was like i think like 300-something but she started coming down at first she was like knocking off inches and then she started knocking off the pounds
311	c: so there's been some success with your mom going and you're kind of watching her success and what she's been doing and you're feeling like huh because you're seeing some results with that
106	t: but i think that i will knock off the pounds
311	c: you want to knock off some you're feeling this might be the right time for you to to make some changes
112	t: yep and then my doctor at the clinic that i go to they said that-oh i forgot what i was about to say laughs but she said that like if you got problems like some people say they the people that are that ask the people do they want to join the inaudible ? i said yeah but some of the people said that the only reason they're gaining pounds is because they're stressed and stuff like that but nothing gets me stressed i'm always happy so i don know i just start eating like food like a lot so that's probably why
314	c: alright so unlike other people who are kind of saying that it's not really their their fault maybe there's other stuff going on you're really saying that for you it's the eating thing you know your mood doesn get affected and that's not why you eat but it's just that you're eating a lot
103	t: yeah but i see that sometimes when i see cake or something i'll be like there's cake right there i want some and i just eat and then eat and sometimes i'll be full and i get hungry i go eat and eat i'll be like i need to slow down
311	c: so you can notice while you're doing it that maybe you should slow down some on that
117	t: yeah
326	c: when the food is in front of you it makes it a little bit tougher to do
331	c: so what are some ideas that you have for how to slow down when foods are right ?
106	t: like like i was thinking like when i when we have dinner like don get as much and have a glass of water so when you eat your food and drink a glass of water you get full right there you don have to eat a whole lot and then i was going to start going to the center that they told me i can start working out and stuff i was going to go there and aerobics at the pool i've been going there like last year i was going there and then i had stopped when it got to winter time and then i started going like i went like last week i went to the pool area with my friends and then after that i haven went back and have i told myself that i was going to stop eating cake and stuff as usually because if i see cake i'm want it so i told myself i was going to calm down on that
328	c: alright so you've actually had a lot of ideas you've been thinking about this even before coming in here on ways that would work for you to to work on getting some of the weight off the pounds yeah and one of them being to take you know smaller portions and drink water with your meals that you can go do and like the water aerobics and stuff and then the other one would be figuring out when there's stuff right there like cake and pizza it's kind of hmm this looks really good how to how to slow down on those foods
112	t: yeah because that was like last year i wasn as big i was in cheerleading and she said if you don want to get you know way too big you can cut down on some of the portions of your food and your water and it gets you full we had stopped cheerleading because our cheerleading coach had had a baby and then we didn have another coach to teach us
307	c: oh kind of a bummer because you found something that was really fun and now you can do it anymore disappointing
119	t: i don know if they got it back though
311	c: so you're just kind of thinking that you know maybe that is something that could be still around
112	t: because in our high school there's cheerleaders there but it's not really my thing at school and then we got fitness and our gym class and stuff like that like every day we have to do something like we either go outside and play basketball or we play soccer on the field and football and stuff like that
311	c: alright so you have some stuff at school that you're doing
117	t: yeah
313	c: but you know when school starts back up but for the moment right now you're kind of trying to figure out what you want to do to to work on the weight now
117	t: yeah
308	c: alright well you know you kind of listed off all those nice things you know addressing both sides of weight loss the nutrition part and the exercise part
117	t: yep
313	c: it sounds like you know you've kind of been watching your mom and you've been doing some stuff too what if any of those would you really want to focus ?
305	c: what if any of those would you really want to focus ?
112	t: really i want to exercise more that's something that i know that i can improve on but it's just that i be lazy so i'm really not doing it even my mama says she'll be like when she tell me like "go outside and get some fresh air" i just be on the couch like "no i'm okay" laughs i just be lazy and then my friends come over and we're always at my house either on a game or on the computer facebook and stuff like that so basically i'm always in the house sometimes or unless we go to the movies or we either go bowling or skating
311	c: alright so you're noticing that that being more active might be something that you want to do and currently you're doing a lot of things like that are more sedentary activities like the tv and the game and the computer and that might be another way for you to work on your weight would be to cut down on the sitting so much
106	t: yeah and then like today i'm supposed to go skating and it's really just like you just around the whole the skating rink is so big so we just go around the whole thing basically i'll do some sitting down skating but basically i'm up i'm starting not to be lazy and stuff like that
313	c: yeah so you've got some you've found some stuff that you like to do and actually when you go do them unlike some other people that go it sounds like you're up and really moving around and not kind of like sitting and chit chatting and you know hanging out like that
106	t: yeah and then sometimes me and my friends we go walking around the blocks or going to the park and stuff like that
313	c: so you're doing again stuff that's active now but in your head it does sound like it's you know that the exercise thing doing a little bit more is kind of where you're moving towards a bit
106	t: yeah and i told her i said that i was going to cut down on the greasy stuff like fried chicken and hamburgers i haven had none of that in a while
313	c: you know so you're also making some food changes and it's been sticking pretty well because you've been able to do it for a pretty you know a little bit of time well tell me when you because you mentioned that you haven really had like the greasy foods like the fried chicken and things and it's been working for a little while
117	t: uh-huh
333	c: how were you able to to not eat those ?
103	t: well some like really when i eat i really don eat because i was like i don like eating really but it's like when i gained the pounds is when i eat cake when i eat junk all the time so basically that's how i got my pounds but i really don like eating like food like chicken and sandwiches i don like i don like sandwiches at all it's like i don eat as much as y'all like people think i do it's just that i eat the junk food that's what made me gain my pounds i don like eating as much but i eat a lot when i see junk food like cake and honey buns and stuff like that but like the food like you know baked beans and chicken and a piece of bread i don eat like that
314	c: so you're able to stay away from these other foods because they're not really something that you enjoy to eat but you kind of keep coming back and repeating that you really noticed when you eat the sweets and the cakes your weight went up quite a bit
112	t: yeah because i'll be like when i inaudible i was like 125 like last year probably and then like this year it just went up and i was like well i've gained some pounds and my doctor had told me that i should join the community project and inaudible
328	c: so you were ready to do something because you saw the numbers change and you weren so happy about that
117	t: yeah
302	c: yeah and you really are mentioning a lot with the the cakes and the cookies and and how much you kind of see that related to your weight and i don know for you know for some people they they want to make some changes in their eating like you know cut down on things and watch portion sizes and other people even you know they even though they know that this is causing their weight gain it's not something that they're ready to to work on
305	c: i don know where you kind of fall in terms of the eating stuff
115	t: i want to like lose the weight but it's like if it's in front of me i'll be like yeah i want that but then i'll be like well i'm really not going to eat it because i'm going to get this off so that's basically what i try to do
313	c: you're already making an effort to to work on that part where when you see it you don eat so much of it
117	t: yeah
326	c: and and that's where there's kind of a difficult part for you
313	c: alright so you're kind of saying like number one you're remind yourself that you are trying to lose weight number two have just a little piece and then get out of there get away from the food go see your friend inaudible
112	t: inaudible if it's in my face i'll be like oh i'm going to eat it but then if i just like take a little piece off be like well i'm going to have to go outside
308	c: alright so really two great ways to kind of get past that if that's what you wanted to do
117	t: yeah
333	c: what are some other things you could ?
106	t: probably like if i see it i probably don want it as much as i do now because like usually i be like snaps cake right there i'm going to eat it but now i just be like uh there's cake right there maybe i'll just get a little piece and go outside but i don like cake it's right there because like my auntie she real real like real skinny like real bony and she keep cake in her house and i'll go over to her house and i usually don eat the cake now usually i'll be like snaps cake right there laughs let me eat it but usually i don eat it now
313	c: so you're noticing a difference that you're you are actually kind of refusing the cake you don have to eat it all the time
117	t: yeah
331	c: you're able to to kind of move past it if you-how are you able how are you able to do that when you're over there and it's
106	t: i just be like there's cake right there and then take my like her house is right here there's a park like right across the street from her so i usually take the kids over there and they play i just play with them like i see the cake and be like i want it but i'm not going to do it
308	c: so you're working really hard to get yourself away from these things
117	t: yeah
331	c: yeah that's really something to hear how much you're willing to kind of like take your cousins out play with them somewhere else or go over to your friend's just so you don have to have it there what are some things that she could do to kind of help you when you know either with you know with that whole idea if you're trying to cut down with the sweets and the ?
112	t: she probably will go she'll go to the grocery shop and she probably will cut down of getting the cookies and the sweets because i got some little sisters and brothers and they like sweets so i know that she will probably cut down just a little and then she probably will bring some more healthier stuff in the house like vegetables and we got that it just didn like some of the vegetables i don eat like they're not really taste good to me so she probably will bring some more healthier stuff in like salad and stuff like that
311	c: okay so there there are some people in your family that she would still be buying the cakes and the cookies for but there could be you know less that she buys
305	c: so when you say that she would do this kind of stuff it sounds like that is actually something that you would like her to do a little bit more of yeah it might kind of for you you'd feel like you'd have a little bit less pressure if it wasn in the house
106	t: yeah because like the snacks stay in like one cabinet and the rest is like vegetables are in the cabinets and stuff like that but i know if i see it i'll probably want like a piece of it but now it's not like that i'm where i see it and be like oh that's right there and and maybe i'll be like i might take a little piece and i think like don just get out of there
311	c: so it really is that there are ways that if you don see it it's helpful
117	t: yeah
310	c: and then a lot of it really falls on you to be strong and to kind of get out of the room and not have any of it
117	t: yeah
311	c: but you know your mom one option for her to help is to to work on not bringing so much of it in and giving the healthy options that are ?
331	c: alright well i mean you know tell me like how how important is it for you to ignore the cakes and the ? if like on a scale of one to ten or zero to ten if like zero was not at all important and ten was like very very ?
112	t: i would say ten because i really want to knock off this weight for real so yeah it'd probably be like a ten
311	c: yeah so i mean you're really feeling that some of this weight you want it to go and you see that the eating part is linking with the the gain
117	t: yep
331	c: yeah and you know so you're kind of around those things but you know why else wouldn you be like a lower number like an ? or
112	t: because i don want this weight i don so i really do want it off like seriously so i would say a ten
311	c: yeah i mean you're you're ready to make some change you want to see the numbers coming ?
106	t: probably i'll be looking at it and then probably be like well i do want a piece but i'm not so it probably be like a probably a seven to an eight i want to say ten but i'm probably going to be looking it like well it's right there i want a piece of that probably be like an eight or seven
313	c: alright so you're thinking really realistically here you're really kind of putting yourself closing your eyes i'm in the situation the cake's right there and you know how you'd you'd feel so you're feeling pretty confident about a seven or eight that you could you could do that
333	c: what makes you not a little bit lower of a ?
112	t: because i know that i could do it
311	c: yeah you've got the confidence in there
112	t: yeah there's no hesitation i know i can do it
311	c: yeah you're feeling strong and you have some plans in your mind about how you're going to do how you're going to get around it
117	t: yep
328	c: well just let me see if i you know kind of could summarize a little bit before we switch places if it's okay with you you know it sounds like you have noticed that you have gained weight and you really noticed that the eating the candy and the the the cookies and the sweets is something that you did that and you started gaining the weight you've also found some really great resources for activity you've got the center and like the water aerobics and you're coming up with some great ideas on on how to work on the weight loss and getting past the seeing the food right there and getting around it come up with great ideas like you know having a small piece and going getting out of the house and going to your friend's or you know if it's at your aunt's leaving there and taking the kids over to the park and you feel it's really an important thing for you to do your confidence you're feeling confident you know that it's going to be something that you know that that's there that's always going to kind of be bugging you but you feel real strong with being able to to kind of walk away from those things
117	t: yeah
324	c: so you're ?
112	t: i actually don know but i don everybody tell me like they they know that i can get the pounds off if i really want to and i am
311	c: so you've got a lot of support from other people and they're kind of building you up there and you also are feeling from your inside that you know you can do this and that confidence and your strength is something that's going to help you kind of push through
117	t: yeah
312	c: but at the same time it's a little bit overwhelming to think about making some of those changes
117	t: yeah
343	c: tell me a little bit more about that
116	t: well we leaving the whole junk stuff like cakes and stuff like leaving it it's like well yeah cake and stuff is good but yeah i know that that's putting the weight on yourself and then be thinking like well i'll have to leave it alone because i'm going to lose this weight and then there it is right there and you'll be looking at it like well it's right there but i'm not going to touch it so basically how to leave it alone
326	c: so you're kind of you're really recognizing that this is going to be a bit of a struggle when you first start off it's not going to be super easy to do and yet you're kind of accepting that and saying like i'm ready i'm going to leave it alone it's going to be tough but i'm going to leave it alone because this weight thing is something i want to do
311	c: so you have this pretty solid idea of of where you want to go in terms of your weight loss and really working on the the eating portion and some of the exercise stuff that you're you're going for
117	t: yep
301	c: now since we're going to be switching places with your your mom in just you know about a minute or so how you know what would you like me or how should i share this information with ?
112	t: i mean you can tell her everything because pretty much i told you she already know so she know about this center and the me going over to my friend's and how that i was going to lose weight by going places with my friends like we go swimming all the time and stuff like that she pretty much knows everything
311	c: okay yeah so you guys talk about this stuff and not a big deal to kind of share it with her
117	t: yeah
301	c: alright and then you know when we come back in together if it's okay with you i might ask you to kind of share that part about you know you mentioned that there were some things that she could do to help you to reach your goal
324	c: and you look a little like you don know if you want to be the one to say that to her
112	t: i could say it to her
311	c: okay so you like you guys again are talking about things and you have no problem doing that stuff
117	t: nope
301	c: alright great well cool i'll have you guys go ahead and and switch places then
117	t: okay
301	c: come on in laughter
