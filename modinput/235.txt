301	c: so i understand that you came to talk with us for a little bit get a couple of things accomplished maybe so just before we get started this is the part of our session where we turn on the video cameras just so that you know okay and also i wanted to let you know that during our time that we spend together we'll be talking about a few things related to weight loss and making some plans and i just wanted to let you know that anything that you and i talk about is private and confidential unless you tell me that i can share information or if you tell me that you're going to hurt yourself or somebody else or a child or an elderly person is in trouble so those are just you know the standard kinds of reasons why we wouldn keep information private so alrighty
120	t: whenever you're ready laughs to turn the camera on
301	c: yep so you know i guess the other thing just to to let you know how today will go is that you and i will spend about 20 minutes together then i'll spend about 20 minutes with your mom
305	c: and then i'll bring you guys together and we'll spend about another 20 minutes together so the reason that we're doing that is because i'd like to talk with you guys about you know different ideas that you might have for weight management and this might be different from the way that you've talked to other people like doctors and nurses or others that you might have had contact with who might have made some recommendations to ?
343	c: have you ever talked to anybody ?
119	t: not really about weight loss like my doctor actually she was sending me stuff about this 'cause i had checked off that i had problem with my weight in one of my charts that she had gave me i had to do a survey so not really like going into full detail about it
327	c: okay alright well it sounds like you so you haven really had a lot of experience talking with people in detail about your weight
117	t: right
305	c: and what you want to do about it and and if you want to do anything and so you know in our conversation today what i'm here to help you do is to make some of those decisions maybe learn a little bit more about what you can do and if you want to do anything and why so you know this is kind of your show which means that i'm here to help you but i'm not going to tell you what to do and i'm not going to make decisions for you so ultimately the choices that you make are your own choices so
117	t: okay
301	c: and you know we can get started just by talking about what you think about your weight
112	t: well i mean it's not really where i want it to be because i have gained weight lately and it's kind of frustrating like when i go shopping for clothes or something oh my god i just i just had this on the other day i could fit in it but i mean it's not really a big deal where i'm stressing myself out over it or anything like that no it's not
325	c: okay so you've noticed some changes and in particular the way clothes fit you and it's frustrating but you don feel like it's a really big deal okay
106	t: and i lately me and my sister have been going to the gym so that's kind of helping a little bit but i mean i mean it's not really a big deal for me i'm not going to go crazy if i gain a couple of pounds or anything like that i'm still a kid so you know it's not really phasing me like that
328	c: okay so overall you know it seems like you have this idea that something probably needs to change and that you've done a couple things like go to the gym and but the big picture for you is that i'm still young you know it's probably not that big of a deal
117	t: right
332	c: okay have you gotten that same message from your doctor as ?
120	t: what about the ? that it's not a big ?
330	c: yep
119	t: i mean like i said we don really go into full detail about it or anything so you know i really haven talked to her about 0:03:59
302	c: okay well i'm wondering if it would be interesting to you to see where you weight falls on a graph as far as body mass index ?
331	c: are you familiar with that ?
120	t: no i didn know you could put laughs like is it like going in with like other peoples' weight or like where you're supposed to ?
305	c: 04:14 yeah yeah would you be interested in seeing something like ?
117	t: yeah
302	c: okay well so what we did today is because the people here the research assistants that we work with they weighed you earlier and then what they did is they put your weight into a computer along with your height and age and everything so if you look at where you fall on a body mass index which is a computation of your height and weight for your age this is where you fall
119	t: oh wow
302	c: yeah which means that this is underweight this is average weight and this is overweight this is obese so in the 97th percentile that's pretty high it's above the 95th percentile which is the cutoff between overweight and obese
331	c: the 85th percentile is the cutoff between average weight and overweight does it surprise you to see that you're up ?
119	t: yeah laughs yeah 'cause i've never seen a graph like this before so
302	c: yeah that's actually news to a lot of people because this isn you know sometimes people see a graph like this when they're looking at a growth chart but not always i mean it's not unusual for a person never to have seen one of these so and you can see too like along the bottom where you fall in and as you get older you can see that the body mass index that's within the normal range gets a little bit higher and that's normal
305	c: so you know just i'm wondering what you think about where you fall on that chart and what that means to you
112	t: well i guess it's like a shock because like i'm heading to the obese range and i don want to be there
302	c: well and we don know where you're headed or how sharply your curve is because we only have one dot on here which means we don know if you were here or here or here the last time you know over the years and it's hard to know just simply because we only have today's data
117	t: right
308	c: yeah but that's a really good point is that you know you don know where you're headed in the next few years either
117	t: mm-hmm
311	c: you know so you know so this is a bit of a shock for you to see that it's up there
117	t: yeah
302	c: and people carry their weight different ways and so when you picture in your mind you know what does an obese person look like there isn really one shape that a person is or there isn really one you know weight that they have that says that they're obese it's like we said a computation and stuff so it might look differently for different people
312	c: you said earlier that your weight wasn really that big of a deal and you know
112	t: yeah but you know it's not but you know when you start looking at stuff like this it starts make you think like should you do something about ?
308	c: that's a really great question to ask ?
331	c: and if you were to answer that question what would you ?
112	t: yeah laughs yeah i need to do something
301	c: well and earlier do you mind if i put this ?
117	t: yeah
313	c: earlier you mentioned that you've started to do something like you work out
331	c: once in a while did you say with your ?
117	t: yeah
302	c: you know and that is something that people do sometimes is they change their activity ?
331	c: so what do you think other things are that people ?
120	t: to what get lose ?
330	c: if they want to change their weight yeah
103	t: eat healthier i know i need to do that i eat a lot of fast food but i've been trying to cut down on that 'cause i know it can affect you badly
330	c: uh-huh
119	t: so eat healthier watch the stuff that you eat when when you eat something like the calories or something maybe like that on the packaging that you read i'm not sure exactly what to do but you know those are the basics that i always hear others talking about
308	c: okay and so those are really you're right those are the two main areas that people work on if they want to make a change as far as their weight ?
302	c: if they want to make a change as far as their weight goes then they focus on increasing their activity and they work on changing what they eat or how they eat
305	c: so if you were to think for yourself you know if you wanted to do something that would make a big change for you what do you feel like would be the best thing to focus ?
112	t: to cut out the fast foods that's that's the main that's like the main part of it all is to cut that out
330	c: okay
103	t: and i'll eat too many burgers laughs or whatever it's like just cutting out the fast food because i do eat it a lot and i need to stop
330	c: okay
109	t: but i think it's like i think that comes from it being so convenient for us to get that we just go right to it because it's there and it's quick you don have to cook or anything like that i think that's the big thing
302	c: yeah a number of people do fall into that trap where it's it's easy to get to
308	c: but you're right you make a very good point when you say the calories are much higher
302	c: i do have some information on fast food that if you would like to see it i can pull that out as well and kind of
305	c: because you mentioned that you might want to make some changes as far as eating and in particu
302	c: let's start with this one i think i have another in here that might be useful to you i'll give you a choice of a few different ones to look at
308	c: and you kind of mentioned a few things that really caught my attention which are really great ideas and that is in particular you mentioned fast food
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: so if you were to think of ways that you might want to focus on managing how you how you eat you could start with looking at this this is a list of fast food choices the lists of the types of fast food that people might eat and there are several because there are lots of different kinds of food out there and what this does is it gives you healthier choices versus unhealthy choices if you're going to eat out and so sometimes people decide well i might not be able to cut out all fast food but when i do have fast food maybe i can at least
112	t: go the healthier way right
309	c: exactly yep
302	c: </sample>
103	t: yes i am addicted to soda i am caffeine drives me crazy and i know that's really bad my mom's been telling me that i need to stop drinking so much pop but it's just so hard laughs it is just so hard
344	c: what do what do you find difficult about ?
103	t: just like getting away from it like i drink so much soda i try to go to juice do juice and stuff like that but it's like nothing can make me feel like that caffeine in me like that laughs so i don know i just
310	c: so you see that as probably a source where you know if you made some changes it could be helpful to you
307	c: but you have already anticipated that it could be quite difficult too
117	t: mm-hmm yeah
308	c: that's a really great insight
302	c: so in this set of papers this is a comparison between different types of drinks that people might have and it shows you the size of the drink as well as how many calories are in there and then maybe some other choices that you might make that could replace some or all of your fast food choices or your soda choices laughs and so as you can see these are the best choices because they have virtually no calories in them these are some good choices too though if you don have too much
310	c: and you can kind of compare like how many calories
302	c: and then finally a third choice that i wanted to mention to you is just keeping track of your food
117	t: mm-hmm
311	c: and you mentioned in particular counting calories and that maybe that would be something that would
331	c: would assist you in making different choices
118	t: no i haven
302	c: so basically all it is is just you write down everything that you eat and drink even it's just like a little cheese cube snack or something you know drink or something you just write the date and time and describe what it was and how much you had because portions like you can see on here the portion size is important and where it came from like did it come from a ? did it come from ? how many calories it had you mentioned looking at the nutrition label
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: do you know how to find that ?
117	t: mm-hmm yeah
302	c: if you wanted to these are some optional columns you could say you know what you had a substitute for so if you had water instead of a soda you could write down the calories that were in the soda as well as the calories that were in the water and then you could see how many you saved which is nice i mean it really kind of is a way of saying wow you know this is what i didn have laughs
331	c: and so some people find that very helpful there are also some rating forms for how hungry you are when you eat 'cause some people eat when they're not hungry and knowing that information what do you think that would ?
112	t: kind of show you like you didn need to eat then you were just eating just because it was there maybe yeah
309	c: exactly yep same thing with food so you know when you start to really write down what you're doing you start to see patterns that you might not otherwise see
117	t: right
305	c: so do any of these look appealing to you as a place to ?
112	t: well i was looking at this one here
301	c: okay okay and i'm going to send all of these home with you so just because you say that this might be a good place to start doesn mean that you can add any of these others
120	t: 15:06 move onto these or yeah i understand what you're saying
301	c: yeah great okay so i'm going to just stick these away so that they're not
331	c: in the way yep alrighty so as you've looked over this did you see anything that jumped out at you in particular that you found ?
112	t: i was just looking at the healthier foods like the choices that they have on here to get instead of like the unhealthy foods just trying to see you know just looking getting an idea of what i would do in a situation where i want i feel like i want a burger but i know i shouldn get a burger so
333	c: what do you picture yourself ?
106	t: i mean probably making the if i'm really if it's something that i really want to do making the better decision to get something healthy instead of you know oh just because i want a burger i'll just go ahead and get one but if it's something that i want to do and i i there's a passion for it or whatever just go ahead and follow the healthier choices instead of going the other way
308	c: okay that sounds like a really you know good choice
313	c: as far as being able to make an informed decision about well if i'm going to find myself here then at least i'm going to make a choice to healthy eat healthier so i can save a few calories
106	t: yeah that's what i was say when i was at the gym when i've been since i've been going to the gym i've been telling myself like i'm going to get out of this stage of having a burger and then going to the gym or eating something that's fatter that what i need to eat but i just have to like push myself like i really want to do this so i have to get in that mind frame where this is what you want to do if you want to do it you have to go out and get it so that's what i'm trying to get myself in that predicament like just no just to say no
302	c: right a lot of people find themselves in that position like you just discussed in that they have a choice that they want to make but sometimes it's hard to really have in your head
119	t: because you're so used to doing the other- the opposite of what you're trying to bring into yep
333	c: yep so what do you think people do when they want to make a change and be able to help themselves make ?
112	t: i just say go for it like try your hardest to stay in the mind frame of doing right and making yourself better and making yourself healthy if you stay in that mind frame then you will be able to go on and do what you want to do but if it's just like too overwhelming for you to do and you just go back to the fattier foods then you don really have too much control over yourself laughs and you're being controlled by everything else really
308	c: so you make a really good point and that is i heard the word feeling overwhelmed
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: you know and that is that when people try to make really big changes all at once sometimes they do feel that way
117	t: right
333	c: how how do you picture yourself being able to manage that so that you can make healthy choices without getting ?
106	t: i think just starting out with the small like small like i said i started going to the gym first and if i started see if i'm not really seeing any results from going to the gym then i know i need to focus on my foods and the gym and try to like weigh them both at the same time and yeah like i said time or something go to the gym or i'm going to eat this after i come from the gym or before i go to the gym just making a plan for yourself basically
308	c: what a great idea
302	c: yeah planning ahead is a really a lot of people find that very valuable and ?
333	c: it sounds like that's something you have a little bit of experience ?
117	t: yeah
333	c: are you a good do you feel like you're a good ?
120	t: yeah my school is based on they help their you're planning ahead so it's like a prep school so they always have us doing things ahead of time so that's where i get that from
309	c: school that's a pretty good skill to have
301	c: yeah well i have a plan that if you would like to take a look at you know it's kind of a skeleton plan but you can kind of fill in what you might want to focus on and why that kind of thing would you
112	t: we can do that yeah
301	c: now some people take a look at this plan and they decide that what would work best for them would be just to talk about it and other people decided they really would just want to have a written plan they can take home and put up somewhere as a reminder so this is what our plan looks like
117	t: okay
305	c: how do you think you might want to use the ?
106	t: i think i would write it down and go over it and then try to get myself to do it before i'm just going to say okay i'm just going to take this plan it's going to be done you have to look over something first to get it in your head that this is what you want to do like i said before so i think just reading it over first and then taking it step by step on what i want to do to get to the next part
308	c: so that sounds like a great choice
305	c: would you be interested in starting that ?
117	t: mm-hmm
301	c: okay so i mean you've kind of had a chance to look over the plan and if it's okay i'll just tell you a little bit about each of the pieces of it so usually what people find valuable is to come up with a a small part of their plan so like your big goal might be to lose a certain amount of weight but this plan might be the first step you're going to take and you mentioned working out and you mentioned also cutting out some fast food calories so you might pick one of those to focus on initially and then you would write down what your plan is like and then you would say why you want to do it so what are your personal motivators for wanting to do that particular ? any good plan involves planning ahead for problems that come up as you probably know from school yep so we would try to identify the major problems that might get in your way and develop a plan in case they come up so that you'll have something ready you can just look at your chart and say exactly yep and then this is an important part too i think you know is just having in mind what's the very first thing that you can do when you leave here today to get started in working towards your ? and then finally a section on social support because it's so much easier to do a plan and be successful when you have somebody who's there to support you or help you in some way so we always encourage people to kind of get some others involved and so
112	t: like i said i have my older sister going with me to the gym and stuff like that
308	c: perfect example
117	t: so yeah
301	c: yep and so we might just say like what specifically you would ask her to do for example
305	c: so what do you ? what do you think your would be your overall 0:22:08
120	t: my overall ?
301	c: yep and then the small one after
112	t: my overall goal i think i want to lose about i'd say 30 pounds about 30 pounds thirty pounds
330	c: okay
106	t: and my plan after that is like basically i already started my plan by going to the gym but i also want to like i said get rid of the fast food so i think yeah it's to cut out that fast food that's really the big problem like the gym it's not a it's not a big like i can go whenever i want because i have this membership now
330	c: okay
112	t: so but the food that's the big problem that's the big issue
311	c: right it sounds like what i'm really hearing you say is that that's something you really need to plan ahead for and have something that you can follow to keep you on track
301	c: well if you would like to i can help you come up with a plan for working on fast food and then you'll have something you can walk away with today in hand to get you started
112	t: alright we can do that yeah
333	c: so then what would you say here about fast ? like what specifically is your plan for fast ?
106	t: basically just to cut down on it yeah to cut down i'm not going to say i'm going to completely get fast food out of my life 'cause i know that's not going to happen but just to cut back a little bit on it not eat it as much as i do now but just cut down a little bit on it
333	c: okay and would it help you to be any more specific about in what way you want to cut down or kind of describe you know a little more detail about when you say cut down what particularly do you mean about ?
106	t: to cut down it's to like basically i just want to not eat so much of it in one day maybe have like one meal from a fast food restaurant or probably like three times a week or something like that just getting a plan on like how many times to eat it or you know stuff like that i have to like really think about like a real plan to like cut down on it instead of just saying cut down on it
301	c: yeah and that's what i'm here to help you with
308	c: because you're right you know when you have more detail then it's easier in the moment to to know whether or not you've met your plan your goal or not you know 'cause you'd have some objective measure
117	t: mm-hmm
328	c: so yeah so i'm going to give you a second to think about it 'cause i can see the wheel
308	c: and you have and you have some very clear ideas and i think you're doing a great job so i don want to get in your way laughs
109	t: mmm i can think of anything i'm just thinking to reduce popped into my head so that's what is in that's what i'm thinking right now
301	c: well you know you did mention some things earlier that if it would help you we can talk through a little bit and then you can make a choice
310	c: so you mentioned the idea that you feel like you drink too much pop and when a person's out at a fast food restaurant that's pretty available
106	t: i mean like the plan would be to like basically it's to choose the healthier side of things to get more healthier basically you have to improve your health because you know like different sicknesses can come from eating fast food or being obese or something like that
313	c: okay so i hear a couple things that you're saying and one is that it sounds like your major focus is to make choices from the healthier side of the menu when you go to a fast food restaurant and i already heard you articulate something here and that is
112	t: to improve health laughs yeah
308	c: yep so if you would like to write those down i mean it's i think that sounds like a fantastic and doable plan
120	t: what do you mean by if this gets in the ?
344	c: well this would be kind of the the planning ahead part where you think about what are what are things that could possibly stop you from making this ?
112	t: mmm maybe your conscience laughs maybe your conscience could be one
332	c: describe for me a little more about how that how you see that being something that stops you from making the ?
112	t: maybe your focus could get in the way of that the focus of just sticking to your plan
312	c: i got you so so like you see yourself sometimes maybe you go into a restaurant and you're just not really thinking about it so
309	c: you might forget to yeah great suggestion
120	t: so i put focus on ?
332	c: can you think of anything else that sometimes like if you picture yourself in a fast food restaurant what's usually going on when you order a bigger meal or a higher calorie ?
120	t: what's usually going ? can you give me an ?
302	c: sure i sure can so some people find that when they go into a fast food restaurant and they're really hungry they're going to order more and they might eat more than they would if they had planned ahead so that might be one example of being extra hungry and not planning ahead some people find that if they're with certain people they order different things and those might be healthier or unhealthier choices
120	t: so can we put environment on ?
305	c: this is your plan so whatever you feel like the word if the word environmental or environment if that's a word that will cue you think okay i know that when the environment is this way i'm more likely to make an unhealthy choice
109	t: well i i would rather put surroundings then surroundings because if i if i was to look at this and see environment i would probably think of outside or something laughs
327	c: mm-hmm yeah a lot of people think that with that word
117	t: mm-hmm
308	c: yeah you make a very good point about putting it in your own words so
109	t: what ? i could say maybe my friends 'cause like you said around certain people you might order different things
301	c: right right and other things might occur to you over time too like now that this is on your mind and you have a plan for what you want to do you might discover things that you hadn really noticed before you know as you're paying more attention to what you're doing in a fast food restaurant so unless you have other particular barriers that you want to list on there we can think of some things that you can do to prevent these from stopping you laughs
106	t: right yeah i think all of it is just basically keeping the plan in mind that you keep in your focus basically in a good mindset that you have a plan and that you're you have a goal basically
333	c: and how would you remind yourself of that so that you can keep it in ?
106	t: i think i'm going to have it somewhere written down laughs to actually remember like okay you know or just having self control i think that would be one
311	c: okay so you mentioned just having it written down is another thing do you have
112	t: 33:01 a reminder
309	c: yeah yeah good thinking
303	c: where do you think you might put a reminder that would be most likely to be ?
106	t: in my phone in my cell phone yep because you know it's when my phone rings i'm just like where is ? so i think my phone would be i'll just put phone
330	c: okay
120	t: what ?
301	c: and then a couple things related to like the the thoughts that you have and the reminders like the physical reminders that you want to come up with and you know as i'm looking at your list right here i'm seeing you know something that could be really useful to you if you feel comfortable
120	t: my ?
311	c: yeah your friends
305	c: laughs if you feel comfortable sharing with them what you're trying to work on and asking them for help
112	t: yeah i guess 0:34:03 i'll put family too i think that's all that can come to me right now
308	c: okay fair enough you've got quite a quite a good list it looks like
305	c: you know you've touched on several different areas so what about ? when you leave here today it's not going to be very long
106	t: right so my first step could be is to keep this in mind when i'm going to get something to eat 'cause i know i'm going to go get something to eat when i leave because mom said she was hungry earlier so i guess just keep my plan in mind will be my first step
331	c: okay and who would you ask for help with reaching your goals on this ?
106	t: i think i would ask my- right now today i think my mom would be who i would ask because she is going to be the one buying food laughs
308	c: that makes sense that makes sense yep that's an excellent insight is that you're not always in charge
112	t: just to help just basically help me stay focused on what i'm trying to do encourage me
308	c: okay those are really great words to help you stay focused and encourage you
331	c: are there particular ways or words that you need to hear from her that would be encouraging for ?
112	t: hmm maybe like if she would say something like do you think that's ? or remember your plan or something like that i'm sure she would say something if she knows that i really want to do this she's going to say something to help i'm not exactly sure what she would say but i'm sure she would say something if she know that i'm trying to do something and she see me slacking a little bit or something
331	c: have you two been down this path before where she was really supportive for ?
112	t: oh yeah she's always supportive always
311	c: so she has some words that she uses for you and
306	c: 37:17 alright well if you look over your plan again how do you feel about it as far as how satisfied are you with ?
112	t: i think i'll be able to do it i just have to push myself because it's something i want so yeah i think i can do it
308	c: you have some good reasons for wanting to do that i mean you know the idea of improving your health is certainly you know a good reason for both now and in the future in particular and you know if you think about this plan and how confident you feel that you can really follow through on this plan how would you rate that like on a scale of one to ten with one being not at all confident and ten being the most confident you've ever ?
112	t: i think i'm at about a six about a six
311	c: okay so kind of mid-level
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: so what made it a six and not like a ?
112	t: well because it was like this had already been like in my mind that i want to get healthier so by me doing this plan it's just made me think a little bit more on what i should do instead of just like okay i'm just going to work out and that's just going to be it because i know that don that doesn always help if you're working out and then you're leaving and you're going to get some burgers or something so yeah i think that's just just gave me a little push
311	c: yeah a nice little boost by having some detail
117	t: yeah
331	c: what about what would it take to bump you up to a seven on your ?
112	t: actually practicing and planning and and trying some steps to get more into it just practicing it
311	c: okay so you feel like once you get some experience doing it it might become easier you might find it easier to follow through on
112	t: it'll be a part of my day or my life or something like that
308	c: that's a really nice way of thinking about it is just integrating it into your life
112	t: it's a part of me
301	c: yep exactly so okay well if you don have any questions about what we talked about in the plan that you came up with what i'd like to do now is i'll i'll take you in the other room and i will meet with your mom for a little bit and i'm going to talk with her about some of the same things that you and i talked about and see how she might be supportive to you and we can share your plan with her in a couple different ways if you want to we can either do it when the two of you come back together if you would like to talk over your plan with your mom you may if you don want to that's fine too if you want me to share it with her before we come together as a group that's okay too okay and would it be okay if i actually show her your ?
117	t: mm-hmm yep
301	c: sounds good and so then when we come back together as a group one of the things that i'll ask you is you know what you would like to tell your mom about your plan and that way the two of you can discuss you know what you'd like to do and what you're hoping she'll be able to do to support you that sounds good well let me take in the other room and i will see you again in a few minutes
