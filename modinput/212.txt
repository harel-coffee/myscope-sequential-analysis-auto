309	c: all right so you made it in
343	c: nice job i'm happy to see you laughs so how do you feel about your ?
112	t: sometimes i wish i could like do stuff my brother inaudible
311	c: so it gets in your way sometimes
116	t: i mean it's not like i get tired i actually stay longer but i wish i could do way more than
311	c: so you can do stuff but you just want to be able to do a little bit more
117	t: yeah
331	c: tell me a little bit more about that
116	t: like in school just period just want to lose weight inaudible i could probably get more friends probably i mean i have a lot of friends
311	c: yeah so i mean you have a lot of friends but you think maybe at school get some more okay
343	c: c and in terms of you know doing things about weight what are some things that you've heard people do when they're going to change they want to lose some ?
119	t: like programs and stuff like workout videos try that playing sports football and stuff like that
327	c: so being active and doing things to kind of increase the amount of energy that you're using
310	c: and it sounds like those are things that you like to do
116	t: no do that i mean want help with it like my mom helps me but
328	c: all right so you have people in your life that are going to help and you're just not quite sure what to do
331	c: like school and sports and those things and the other side of the equation just being the eating part the nutrition piece what are your kind of thoughts on ?
116	t: well i started eating breakfast like later you know for some reason my-and then i tried to even it out to two meals a day and then always end up something to eat in the middle because like the breakfast thing kind of throwed me off so that that's really it
313	c: so you were making some changes to your eating trying to pay attention to the frequency of your meals
308	c: adding in that most important meal of the day breakfast and you're just doing that on your ownample>
112	t: yeah because one day i just want to do it and see what happens
311	c: just to try it out inaudible
331	c: and how is it going so ?
115	t: pretty good though yeah i stop eating-it makes me now when i-i probably like like playing football or playing a game or something i won eat but if i'm like sitting there then i'll end up going and getting something to eat with it
311	c: so if you're being you know if you're occupied with other stuff you're less likely to kind of just munch throughout the day
117	t: mm-hmm
308	c: well it's really impressive to actually hear the stuff you're already doing to help to manage your weight
106	t: yeah like i do hobbies like you know how you build stuff i got you know those building cards you put
345	c: like the ?
106	t: yeah i do those that really helps me out it keeps me focused and not eating
327	c: yeah you really need to have a lot of detail to put those together put the decals on the right way
120	t: i have one where the wheel well one little piece about that big snapped and i couldn get it on
307	c: that's the worse because then you've got to just start over laughs sorry
328	c: so you spend a lot of time on that and you notice that you are less likely to go eat or get distracted with the food if you're busy so that's one way that you are working on the nutrition part along with breakfast
112	t: yeah keep on
311	c: yeah keep on doing what you're doing you know
305	c: so what would be helpful for ? talking about something maybe a little bit more or really happy with where you're at and work on really sticking with those ?
106	t: i'm pretty happy what i'm doing now trying to like every day i trying to even the food down to like maybe a little bit or something like that
313	c: so you're really paying attention to portions as well
117	t: yeah
305	c: well what in particular do you want to focus ?
328	c: because you have talked a lot about nutrition
309	c: and those positive things you're doing
117	t: yeah
328	c: and then you've also mentioned the activity part
301	c: and so we can really kind of focus in on either nutrition or activity\
117	t: mm
305	c: what would you ?
117	t: i really don know
310	c: it's kind of pretty even in what you're doing already with both
117	t: yeah
328	c: so let's see so you're doing some activity
343	c: tell me a little more about the stuff you're doing right now
106	t: like i walk i walk just going out to ride the bike with my brother play basketball evening out there but still
313	c: so every day you do something that gets you moving
106	t: mm-hmm yeah my sister hyper so like she's 19 we also do everything with
313	c: so keeping up with her she really gotta be moving around
120	t: yeah she really hyper
302	c: okay well i have a little information about recommendations in terms of physical activity would you want to take a peek at ?
117	t: sure
305	c: so this whole handout here kind of peek through and you know kind of let me know if this gets boring or you want to talk about something else just be like "hey katie let's move on" ?
302	c: and i don know if this is something you've seen before either in a health class or talking with people about activity before but it really talks about getting you know at least an hour of high intensity activity about three days a week
112	t: yeah but i need to learn about the stretching
311	c:  so there are some pieces like the stretching is a little bit different
112	t: yeah the strength
328	c: that's new and the strength but as far as the aerobic goes you're doing that
309	c: good all right
328	c: and when you think about kind of looking at this recommendation of you know 60 minutes at least three days a week of this walking fast or running or basketball those sports you feel like you know that's something that you're doing
106	t:  yeah like running
309	c: all right good
305	c: and so that's not really anything that you want to change you know add a little bit too or work on
112	t: yeah i would add stuff in to feel more better for me
328	c: so it's always kind of coming back to that if you-you know you want to be able to play more with your brother you want to be able to do a little bit more at school playing the sports all right and then you said like the stretching and the strength these you'd be interested in learning a little bit more about
112	t: mm-hmm yeah i need just a period of learning how to do all that stuff
308	c: you know it's pretty cool that you kind of said it that you just need a period of learning how to do that stuff like you know that sometimes you need to find out the information because you know you're not just supposed to know it you gotta learn it that's pretty cool
117	t: i really don know
310	c: yeah so it's almost that you know maybe even figuring out how to find that stuff would be a good way to think about getting the activity in okay because you're already doing aerobic thinking about the times and everything
331	c: well you know who's a person that you could ?
119	t:  who do you mean ?
331	c:  you know anybody in your life that you know that you could ask about more strength or stretching type of ?
112	t: my dad maybe
311	c: okay so if you wanted to do more he would be somebody that you could ask
117	t: mm-hmm yeah
305	c: all right well looking at this stuff and saying that it's you know kind of saying three days a week of the one hour 60 minutes of activity is the aerobic and then mixing in the strength and the stretching what if any of these would you want to think about working on to increase your fitness and to kind of get so you can play with your brother ?
112	t: like kick boxing
311	c: okay so you're really thinking that finding some even some more aerobic stuff to do like the kick boxing would be a good way for you to kind of jump into that and to work on the weight loss okay
302	c: well sometimes i work with people they put together a little bit of a plan and i don know about doing something like this together
328	c: so it's a little-you know this kind of paper it's like whoa what am i talking about when i say kind of a plan well it's really saying that it's helping you to kind of really think about focusing on one thing that you'd really like to work on and you know we kind of came in and you'd mentioned all the things that you're doing really positive like the food stuff breakfast you're working on keeping yourself busy so you're not really snacking as much throughout the day and then you also were telling me a lot about the activity that you're doing possibly thinking about doing this a little bit more on the activity part and
112	t: like i'm playing football in high school
310	c: oh so you're really kind of getting ready for that that's going to be a lot of fun and a big part of your time yeah a lot of time well and so a lot of times when i work with people they'll put a plan together where they really try to focus on just like one little thing one small thing that they really wanted to talk about working on or keeping up with you know so what would it be that if anything that you might like to work on in order to keep with the weight loss goals that you'd been ?
301	c: well and so a lot of times when i work with people they'll put a plan together where they really try to focus on just like one little thing one small thing that they really wanted to talk about working on or keeping up with you know
305	c: so what would it be that if anything that you might like to work on in order to keep with the weight loss goals that you'd been ?
106	t: strength like just to get stronger and stuff because i think i'm stronger than what i am
313	c: so really focusing on the strength part number one for those kinds of things and also you're thinking about football and
305	c: okay all right you want to write or you want me to ?
119	t: i'll write
328	c: okay all right so you're really thinking that you know you want to play football and lose some weight and when you you know kind of leave here you mentioned the kind of strength thing ?
333	c: is that i mean how are you going to be working on the strength part of ?
106	t: basically push ups and stuff like that and i'm getting a punching bag just to that so that's basically it
313	c: okay so really kind of doing some things around the house that you can do on your own that really help your fitness level
117	t: mm-hmm
309	c: okay great ?
331	c: well why why do you want to do those kinds of things
116	t: i don know something like i guess i'm interested in something like that
311	c: so it's not you know it's kind of fun too
119	t: write it ?
305	c: sure if you'd like so really this getting stronger prepari
311	c: so really this getting stronger preparing yourself for football getting ready okay
302	c: so there you know sometimes there are things that get in the way of your plan to you know maybe think about working on the punching bag or doing sit ups on a regular basis
344	c: you know so what are some things that could get in the way of you doing ?
313	c: so this is something that you've kind of decided that you would like to do
112	t: no because my mom has a schedule she wrote out i think last year like wednesday i have to wash dishes no sunday and monday i have to wash dishes and maybe the next day after that be my inaudible i do that stuff basically in the morning or at night
311	c: so it doesn take your whole day
120	t: like person personal stuff like that
310	c: so you're able to really see what you have to do that day
311	c: so you're already thinking about how it's going to fit into your day and how you can be flexible with it
305	c: something happens in the morning i'll do it at night you know that's kind of easy well what is the first step that you can take in order to reach this goal of increasing your strength activities like the push ups
106	t: get into more school stuff again like practicing like that
313	c: all right so using more of the sports at school being on the teams to
117	t: yeah
308	c: that will be a cool you know cool way for you to get involved
305	c: so what's something you could do like when you leave ? like if you you know if you were going to go home and say like okay you know you got a chance to talk and you know "maybe i do want to do more strength activities i do want to do that" well what's something like that you could do to get into that ?
106	t: just a real a basic thing just do what i was doing like walking stuff like that
325	c: so really keep up with the activity and nutrition things that you are already doing and you're not really sure if fitting in the strength is something that you're ready to do now
331	c: but you're thinking about it so if you you know so tell me a little bit about-let me see like how how important is it like on a scale of one to ten where one would be not at all important and ten would be very ?
112	t: i'll say a six
311	c: all right and there's a six in terms of just so i make sure i i have it down in terms of like starting the strength exercises
331	c: ? okay so that's that's important and what makes you say a six and not a lower number like a ?
112	t: because i actually kind of like care about it and stuff
311	c: something you want to do
331	c: what would it take to bump you up a little higher to say like maybe like an ?
112	t: if i had like stuff to use maybe like  like the weight lifts or something like that
311	c: so more equipment
309	c: or you know more formal kind of programs or activities to do
333	c: all right i mean it makes sense that when you have more of those things then it's kind of easier to do that stuff well if you wanted to get more of those things how would you do that
117	t: i don know
308	c: all right so kind of coming to that part where you know you have these really awesome ideas and it's sometimes just a little support of putting them into action might be helpful
112	t: i have support really just
329	c: i didn hear you i'm sorry
117	t: i really don know
308	c: well that's fair i mean again you're kind of being really honest and saying like you know you're not just going to tell me something that's pretty cool
310	c: and so finding out more info and if it's helpful to you maybe that's something that you could talk to your mom about
305	c: i don know what your thoughts are on that <
106	t: well my i go to my uncle's house and use his stuff really so i really using that
313	c: so you-so one option you have is to go over there
331	c: and to use his equipment all right all right so what is something that your mom could do in order to help you reach your goal of the strength ?
112	t: she's been doing pretty good
311	c: so she does a lot of stuff to help you with that
120	t: yeah like if i inaudible she'll know and then told me not to inaudible that make yourself inaudible
311	c: you're really talking in general to help you with the weight loss she's really helpful to say like okay a little reminders and do stuff and you like that it's helpful to you
309	c: okay nice you have a nice mom
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: and if you know and i think if we're talking like really specifically about if you were like "okay i want to do more strength exercises" you know what could she do to help you with that ?
117	t: inaudible
305	c: it's not really up to her yeah it's up to you you to do it
117	t: mm-mm
311	c: what she's doing so far is great
117	t: yeah
308	c: well all right so really great stuff that you're doing with the food eating breakfast working on snacking less because you're working on the models and other things and being active okay cool
301	c: well kind of at a point where we could switch places if you like with your mom
119	t: you can show her yeah
