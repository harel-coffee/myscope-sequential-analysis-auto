301	c: oh well i just want to kind of let you know this is when they are going to turn the cameras on
117	t: okay
306	c: okay and you're fine with that
117	t: mm-hmm
327	c: no problem
117	t: mm-mm
301	c: alright and everything you say in here is confidential unless you let me know you're going to hurt yourself or somebody else
117	t: laughs okay
330	c: yeah it's kind of inaudible to think about or there's a child or elderly person in trouble
305	c: and really i'm not here to to tell you what to do in terms of just being able to talk about nutrition and activity and weight loss because a lot of times that doesn really help people so i don know if you've talked to people before about this stuff but it might be a little bit different in that way
117	t: okay
301	c: okay cool alright so now that all that is out of the way we have kind of a a little bit of a chance to talk before i talk with your mom
117	t: okay
343	c: and see if there's anything you guys want to work on before you leave so you know how do you feel about your ?
106	t: i guess it's okay i mean sometimes i think that i could be smaller but i mean i'm active i'm not like a lazy person i play softball but other than that i think i could do better
313	c: okay so you're active now here
112	t: mm-hmm no actually i'm active from april to june
311	c: softball season
117	t: yeah
311	c: mm-hmm and you're noticing that there are some other times during the year where you could also do some activity too
117	t: mm-hmm
323	c: yeah you feel really happy when you get to play softball
117	t: yeah
310	c: and move your body so one idea that you have for a way to lose weight which is really a healthy way is to kind of do your sports that you do right now and maybe think about adding to other times of the year
109	t: well i used to do dance but my teacher got into an accident and we haven been doing any since
307	c: oh that's kind of disappointing isn ?
117	t: yeah
311	c: yeah so there are other times
117	t: yeah
343	c: yeah so tell me a little bit more about that stuff
119	t: i did hip hop for a year and then i did ballet for a year ballet was kind of different like i wasn really expecting it it was kind of different like it made me more flexible but it was kind of different and hip hop i like because i got to jump around a lot
311	c: laughs and that was way more fun
117	t: mm-hmm
311	c: than the ballet yeah so you actually do a few different things in order to be active or you you did in the past and you see that as one fun way for you to kind of work on your weight
117	t: yeah
312	c: alright and you mentioned that you're not very unhappy about your weight
117	t: yeah
331	c: alright well what types of things are you talking about ?
112	t: like when i go shopping with friends it's like i'm not it's not harder for me to find my stuff but like they're like littler than me so it's weird but i mean you get used to it after a while so it's not a big deal i get treated the same as all of them so
308	c: so your friends are really great friends you're a great friend to have so they like you very much
312	c: and you know they don really say anything about your weight or when it's going
109	t: no i mean like we all joke around but like i'm not like that sensitive so it doesn get to me like that we joke around a lot like i have friends that's my size i have friends that's bigger than me i have friends that's we're just a weird group of people
308	c: mm-hmm yeah but your friendship isn based on your size your friendships are based on who you are
117	t: yeah
311	c: and you have a lot of fun with them yeah and you just noticed that there are some times when you go out with your friends that there are some clothes that you'd like to fit into a little bit more
117	t: yeah
331	c: yeah okay alright well other than you know your friends and maybe fitting into some different clothes you know what other thoughts do you have about why you'd want to lose ?
305	c: if you want to lose weight
112	t: well my mom says that there is a possibility that if i get any bigger i might get diabetes and i don want to have diabetes because my granddad has diabetes and he's like not doing good
307	c: it's it's feeling kind of scary to see
117	t: yeah it
308	c: and you don want to have to go through that stuff you know not a lot of people kind of can think ahead like that can kind of say like wow you know if i can do stuff about my health now and work on it it's going to be i'm going to be a healthier adult i'm going to be healthier as i grow up
112	t: yeah and plus my mom like she bugs me about it she'll say like "you don want to end up like those people like people that's bigger it's not healthy for you" and i understand that but like i get it i don think that she has to tell me all the time
312	c: mm-hmm so it's a little bit of a bug in your ear
112	t: c: she loves you too
312	c: yeah but you wouldn mind if she didn do it as often
112	t: well it's helpful sometimes but sometimes it hurts because like the way she puts it sometimes but other than that it is helpful because i don want to have to shoot myself in the stomach with a needle
311	c: yeah that the consequences
112	t: i don like needles yeah
311	c: of of kind of letting you know if you were to have health problems it would be really
117	t: yeah
331	c: okay and what would you like to you know how would you like to see her talk to you about weight ?
112	t: i mean i don know i just don like talking about bad stuff i like talking about good stuff stuff that's probably fun to me
311	c: mm-hmm so really focusing on the positive things that come out of of you working on your weight
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: to keep going with stuff okay alright well how about if i kind of put that again on like a little bit of list of things that we might come back to
117	t: okay
312	c: in terms of you know before we finish up alright so you've mentioned a lot about activity and you haven really wanted you know wanted to talk about the eating part of weight loss
106	t: yeah i mean i eat but i think i cut down a lot because like two years ago i would have like just eating and eating because i think that i used to take my feelings out on eating and then it just used to be food in the house so i'd just eat it all up but now my mom she seems to be like worried so i try not to eat that much and we have like lots of-she won get like anything she might get something unhealthy but like it won stay in the house because she'll throw it out or give it to somebody and like she buys stuff that i know i like like i like popcorn but it's not like that bad and at dinnertime i mean i probably get too much but Ã£Â¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢Â¦
311	c: alright so you're kind of noticing you're seeing a lot of the positive things here that around the house there aren very you know a lot of sweets or things
109	t: but sometimes healthy stuff doesn make your cravings better it's like just eh
312	c: doesn quite get
109	t: ice cream
312	c: so you'll kind of go and find other things
117	t: yeah
332	c: how does that help with your your craving and your kind of your goals towards weight ?
120	t: how does what ?
332	c: how does it when you when you do go and and find the ice cream or other little things that you're craving
109	t: i don think it helps but like it tastes good so
332	c: so you get your taste in
109	t: um nothing
329	c: okay and i'm being a little confusing with my questions i'm sorry
117	t: laughs
302	c: silly me well i guess when i you know sometimes when i meet with people like sometimes when people don have anything for a while and they they go and they see some ice cream and they see cake or whatever it is they just want to have so much of it they kind of overeat way too much
112	t: see i don think i could like eat a whole cake because my mom would never let me because she's a baker so we always have sweets in the house but like i i can eat some but i can eat it like how people would eat if like there is a baker in the house because she won let me and then she'll just take it to her job and then i'll come home and be like where's the cake ?
311	c: laughs so she's kind of keeping an eye out on on
103	t: like she keeps an eye out but she also lets me slip sometimes which i like because i think that i should eat healthy but get to slip sometimes but i think my problem is that i slip and then during the summertime i don do much like i just stay at home and watch tv but during school time i get more active because that's when all my sports come out so
328	c: oh okay alright so i guess on the eating side of things if i can kind of sum it up is that you you have a lot of healthy things around the house
103	t: yeah but some weeks my mom like she has her cravings so she goes and gets some i get some like one week we had like a lot of dairy queen some weeks we slip a lot
314	c: so you're noticing even that while you're mixing in the healthy stuff there are some times when there's a little bit more
112	t: well not really but you can tell like when you're eating too much like i can explain it like you can tell when you're not eating the stuff that you need to be eating like if i'm eating chips every day i'm not supposed to be eating chips every day it's not good
308	c: mm-hmm it really sounds like you have a pretty you have a lot of good knowledge about the way to kind of eat healthy but still get the foods that you like to eat you know by saying that you know i like to have some things but maybe having them every day isn the healthy thing to do for weight loss
117	t: thank you
328	c: when it comes to this stuff so you know you you have that part to work with and the eating part and it sounds like you and your mom are kind of doing that together a bit where you know she's keeping healthy things around and you're really feeling that activity finding the activity during the summer when you're not in sports
103	t: yeah because during the summer i think i like gain a lot of weight during the summer and end up losing it during the school year and gaining it back and losing it because in the summer i'll just like eat and then go lay down and watch tv because i have nothing to do because i don go outside around my house because like there's not good people out there so i just stay inside and do nothing unless i go to my friend's house and we'll just go swimming or something
312	c: okay so not a lot of options at home
311	c: yeah but one thing that you do sometimes and you can do is go to your friend's and go swimming
333	c: alright well what else would you know what other things could you do if you wanted to get active ?
109	t: well my mom she's been wanting me to go to the track and walk with her but i don like being bored and like i get really out of sorts really quick and i won do it if i'm bored like walking i think it's for more for like older people because like they like walking i don like walking it's boring to me like i might rollerblade or something but walking is boring
311	c: and you want to find fun activities you like softball and you mentioned like the hip hop stuff
112	t: and i want to get into kick boxing but my mom can find me a class yet so
313	c: alright so you guys are looking for one too
117	t: mm-hmm
311	c: a a fun activity so really finding something to do during the summer and kind of keeping that up through the year for activity is what you're feeling is going to kind of help you keep the weight
112	t: yeah because that's what i think is my problem the summertime i think that's a lot of peoples' problems because like people that don live in good areas can really go outside especially if you're like my age because you don want to get caught up in the bad stuff so i just stay inside
308	c: you know you're being smart by keeping yourself safe but you're kind of missing out on being outside and being active
117	t: yeah
302	c: yeah alright you know i have a couple thoughts i don know if i could share with ?
103	t: well i'm i stay on the computer like the computer i love it and tv i probably watch the most tv like from nighttime and up because other than that i'll either be on the computer and like some days i'll go back and forth to my mom's room to bother her and stuff but i watch during the summertime i watch a lot of tv and stay on the computer but we also go to the mall from like twelve o'clock to six o'clock and we walk around the whole mall and go to the movies with my friend so i think that's probably the only exercise that i do get during the summer
328	c: okay so you've noticed a lot of time that you spend is you know tv and computer time
117	t: mm-hmm
309	c: and the computer okay alright
328	c: well in the time that we have left i just want to know like you know you've come up with some really great ideas in terms of of this fact that you know you think getting more activity on a regular basis right now would help you lose weight and you also have brought up some things with the food where you know you have times where you you enjoy different little
117	t: mm-hmm
333	c: and i don know you know what would you like to focus ? you know kind of like come up with an idea maybe to work on when you leave here if you just had to kind of like pick something small to really focus ?
112	t: probably cut down on the eating like snacks probably because i snack a lot i think it's because you get bored and then you get the munchies and then i think that's why i'm exercising more because like i don mind exercising i actually like exercising but it's like hard to find stuff to do during summertime except for ride your bike and play with friends which i don do because i don have friends around the house so
326	c: mm-hmm so you're kind of you're stuck right now in the fact that you're home and you get bored at home because your friends aren there
117	t: yeah
328	c: and it's really and so then you kind of munch a little bit and so that's one you know big thing you think you can work on right now
301	c: and would writing down some of this be helpful to you or just kind of talking about ?
112	t: i think talking is better because writing down it doesn really work for me because i don really get it i think i don get it it's
305	c: yeah fair enough thanks for letting me know what's best for you because that's what's going to do the most you know help for you this isn about me laughs
331	c: alright so really kind of thinking about the whole idea of the munchies if you had to have just a little bit of a a plan with what you were going to do with that what would that ?
112	t: probably like snack only twice a day between each meal because usually i just like snack just all day so i think that's what i could do to like
311	c: alright so really kind of give yourself like a this is my between breakfast and lunch snack
117	t: yeah
331	c: and have like your you know that this is when i'm going to have a snack and then i'm done alright well what is the the most important reason that you'd want to do ?
112	t: to get healthier so that i won be unhealthy and then i can be good for my senior year
311	c: okay so you're really thinking about senior year maybe some prom
117	t: laughs
324	c: dresses and you want to be healthy and you know i noticed a little bit when you said so you don want to be unhealthy that you were a little unsure like you were kind of maybe just saying
115	t: yeah because i don want i don want to be like i can explain it like i don want to be the one that says like "oh let's go get ice ! instead of saying "like let's stay home and just like go for a bike ride or something" i mean i want to be healthy but at the same time i want to be unhealthy sometimes
311	c: so really mixing it in not saying like i'm never going to have ice cream again
109	t: yeah i don yeah i can do that
305	c: that's not for you and and
117	t: yeah
302	c: you know if i can kind of share with you that's actually you know a healthier for some people a healthier approach so that they don go to that crazy i'm going to eat the whole gallon of ice cream extreme
117	t: yeah
308	c: as opposed to just having a little bit getting a taste and then going you know having other healthy things too yeah
313	c: so again you're kind of bringing your smarts up here the way you're approaching your weight loss i like that so you really have this idea that you're looking forward to senior year you want to be healthy and cutting back on the snacking
117	t: yeah
344	c: and keeping that one do that what are some things that could get in the ?
109	t: if my sister moves back in and brings her snacks with her
312	c: okay because they'll just be around little reminders
117	t: yeah
344	c: and what ?
109	t: hmm probably i don know what could be maybe if i like try to eat too much and then i get right back on the same track and i think that's what happened last time because i went to a nutritionist but she had me on rice cakes and stuff she said "oh you should eat these" and i
312	c: it wasn fun to have somebody tell you what to eat at all
109	t: yeah i don like doing that
305	c: so you feel a little bit more in control now because you're the one who's deciding what you're going to have for snack
112	t: i think that's me like i like being in control of me like i don like anybody else saying like 'you have to eat this and you can eat that"
311	c: mm-hmm yeah you don like to be told what to do
112	t: yeah on some occasions
305	c: laughs alright so you know kind of thinking this you know like your plan now is coming a lot from you it makes it a little bit
112	t: easier
312	c: easier and better to stick to okay so you've kind of come up with this idea that if your sister moves back in that might get in the way of your snacking
112	t: unless my mom has a good talk with her of hiding her snacks from me
311	c: oh so one of the things you can do is kind of have your mom talk to your sister because her moving back in is a pretty good chance so she's going to have to do that
120	t: yeah that might happen
311	c: alright so you're really thinking ahead talking to your mom being the one thing
333	c: you know what else could you ?
112	t: i think i want to get the whole family involved though because it's it's better to like work out with everybody so you'll have moral support than just try to do it all by yourself
311	c: alright so getting them involved would be more helpful too
112	t: yeah because i think if it benefits me they'll probably do it
308	c: good you've got a good good family you're a good member of the family and so they want to be good to you too
333	c: alright well i mean what's the first thing that you could do in order to to reach your goal of you know cutting back to maybe two snacks a ?
106	t: go grocery shopping
313	c: yeah grocery shopping
106	t: for healthy stuff only
313	c: alright so you're stocking up the pantry and the kitchen with good snacks that'll fit into this plan
106	t: mm-hmm and then maybe make it like a graph that tells me like what i can get and what time i need to eat it
313	c: so writing you know writing it down having that kind of out there a little bit more
106	t: and posting it on the refrigerator
311	c: so you see it wow you're pretty serious so that you know you can kind of keep reminding yourself and that will be helpful to you to stay on track with ?
117	t: yeah
308	c: wow so very you know you have actually a lot of different steps kind of planned out for yourself to be clear with sticking to your plan there
112	t: yeah i think it's better when you talk to somebody so you can make sure that you're like on the right track because like so you can see if you're doing the right thing or you're not or what you need to be doing
311	c: and it's helpful for you to have somebody kind of say like guiding a little bit
117	t: yeah
308	c: inaudible alright wow well well if you if you are interested i think you have a really awesome idea
117	t: thank you
302	c: and you know people who want to be successful with weight loss do all the things that you're mentioning right now you know they they make a plan they get other people to support them they you know work you know write it down and remind themselves and and they also kind of keep pushing through you know like they'll they'll have a treat and then they'll get back to their plan and those things so you have a really healthy approach to to managing your weight
117	t: thank you
309	c: impressive yeah
331	c: so what's something that your mom can ? you mentioned you know maybe if your sister moves back and she can talk but what's something she can do right now to help you with the ?
112	t: help me she can help me say like what i should eat like give me ideas of like what would be good for me to eat because like knowing me i'll probably put oh we can get these low fat cookies and we can put them on there i think she can help me by doing that and she can also help by probably cooking healthier dishes like she tried to get away from fried food and that's okay but like it was hard i think she's like on the right track like she's way better than me but sometimes her cravings she could keep to herself so because sometimes i don even be thinking about them
311	c: alright so working together and she has a lot of ideas for healthy snacks and but also you know if she's going to have something maybe kind of not mention it to you as much
112	t: yeah like sneak it and go get it
311	c: yeah okay alright because that's a it makes it easier for you if you
117	t: yeah
309	c: okay alright okay so you know some good ideas for for things
301	c: and how do you want to share these with your ? you know how can i just talk to her when she's in here and and then
112	t: you can tell her
311	c: okay so it's better if i kind of share some stuff with her
117	t: yeah
301	c: alright and what do you want to kind of share when we the three of us come back in ?
117	t: hmm i don know
301	c: yeah so it's kind of yeah so at that time when i meet with people sometimes you'll have you know sometimes people want to actually tell their mom or dad when they're in here what their plan is you know and see what they think about it other times they'll want to tell them like "you know ? if you want to help me lose weight this is something that you can do or this is what you can say to me"
305	c: i mean i don know what would be good for you to kind of
112	t: i think it would be better if you tell her because it's kind of easier talking to you than my mother because she's my mom and when she gets in here we can just talk about stuff that she can help by making me a healthier child
311	c: okay alright and so stuff for healthier child and you've got some ideas on how you're staying healthy cool sounds good alright
301	c: well in that case i'm going to have you guys switch places
120	t: so am i coming with ?
