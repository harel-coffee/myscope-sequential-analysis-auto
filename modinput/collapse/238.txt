308	c: you're checking on that you like to be precise about things ? make sure you heard everything right
306	c: so you got through all the paperwork all the questionnaires and everything went ?
117	t: uh-huh
301	c: cool well now we have a chance to meet and talk about things related to nutrition and activity and weight loss and i just want to let you know that the cameras are going to turn on now you talked about that with toya before
323	c: so it doesn seem like it's a problem
301	c: okay alright and everything you say in here is going to be kept confidential unless you let me know that you're going to hurt yourself or somebody else or that there is a child or elderly person in trouble ? mainly we're just doing this to to learn about you know how to talk to people about weight
323	c: and again no problem there
305	c: so you might have talked to people before about weight and nutrition what to eat and what kind of exercise to do and this may be a little bit different 'cause i'm actually i'm not here to tell you what to do a lot of times that's not very helpful to people really my job is just to to see what help you might need see what ideas you have and if there's anything you know what you'd like to work on when you leave okay
343	c: so tell me a little bit about how you feel about your weight
112	t: i don really feel that much like i don feel sad i'm not happy about my weight i want to lose it but i'm not really sure
311	c: well you're you're a happy guy and so it doesn make you sad but it is something that you'd like to work on you want to lose it
331	c: what reasons do you have for wanting to lose some ?
112	t: i don really know 0:02:09 weight loss so i maybe run faster the way that i usually do
311	c: cool get your speed back
112	t: because i'll be ready for football next year so
311	c: so you kind of have a goal in mind of getting ready for football /text>
112	t: sometimes me and my brother and my 0:02:42 we're going to sign up for football 0:02:46
313	c: so you're doing some practicing and football is something that's really important to you you want to keep playing it you like it
106	t: i've played ever since '06
309	c: oh nice
313	c: so four years now
117	t: yeah
311	c: it's something that's really fun for you and you've noticed that your weight has kind of gotten in the way on how well you can perform
307	c: and it's a little hard to think of it that way
333	c: so what ideas do you have or what kinds of things have you already been doing in order to to lose some ?
106	t: trying to stop not to eat that much going outside i go outside like for two hours and maybe come back in and then run with my brother and go cook dinner and 0:03:45 and they run and like finish that so we can finish and stuff
328	c: so people you and people in your family are are doing things together both with eating and with activity yeah
308	c: so you already know a lot about what it takes to lose weight it takes both both pieces there
328	c: alright so your your brother is pretty you know supportive of what's happening with your weight and he'll be doing some different things with cooking and you mentioned that you want to eat less
333	c: how how do you do ?
106	t: well mostly come home and when i come home i eat like a little something like a little snack and i don have much for dinner
313	c: so you're having the snack and then you eat the dinner and that's something that's different than what you used to do before
331	c: so what have you noticed since you started making that change in your ?
112	t: well it like okay last month you know i did all the running i put on my school pants 0:05:17
311	c: you lost some weight
106	t: yeah the last i noticed that i keep on add on the time that we go outside it used to be like 15 minutes and we added until it was 60 and then it's yeah we added to an hour and then two hours
313	c: so the activity piece really helped you to lose weight
331	c: what made you decide to add time on like ?
309	c: you know not everybody would just be like yeah i want to keep keep going and then
112	t: because i like i like to exercise i like to run and i like to catch the ball you would be surprised how i run because from my first year at school my gym teacher said wow you thought i couldn even run that fast i can run fast but i want to run faster
310	c: so already i mean you're you're fast but you want to take it to the next level and you're really noticing that because it's so important to get there and you know bringing your weight down is going to really help you push that level
311	c: alright so the activity stuff is really fun and you're going outside and even in the wintertime you're going to be able to to get all that time ?
332	c: what's going to happen with the the snow and the ice and the cold ?
112	t: once it's gets cold i just i don even think about that yet i don know what we're going to do we might my brother got some weights so we might go downstairs and just workout so
307	c: so it's kind of hard to think about what you're going to do when you can go outside and and run around so much yeah
304	c: one idea that you have going downstairs and doing some of the workout that would be more of the the whole you know you'd be getting into some muscle building with the strength but not as much of the cardio that it sounds like you really want to focus on in order to get faster pause
310	c: it almost sounds like figuring out a way for you to stay active when the weather gets really cold might be a way for you to keep on track pause
325	c: but you're not really sure
306	c: so just to check in you're not really sure about what to do or you're not really sure if you know you want to try to figure out ways to stay active during the ?
109	t: well i'm really not sure of how to stay active in the wintertime
305	c: so it's not a question about thinking it's it's an important thing you know you know you want to do it
307	c: it's trying to figure out what the heck to do
331	c: okay alright alright well what are some ideas that you do ? are there places you could go or people you could talk ?
106	t: well they have gym class at school so we go on tuesday and thursday tuesday we may play basketball or something i don play basketball i kept on running around and stuff and when i get done like i don like it's a small gym so i run like 20 laps it's not like it's not that long but when i get done like if they're still playing basketball i might join
308	c: you're really dedicated to keeping yourself in shape and really working on losing weight you know you'll keep running even when the rest of the class isn doing it
305	c: what what makes you want to do that ?
112	t: because it's really my goal to be faster so i can be a running back so it comes football time i'm think i'm gonna be like a big man not a like a chunky man a big man fast
308	c: you really are able to keep your goal in mind all the time you know you're always going for that football for football alright
328	c: so activity during the wintertime is one place that you kind of see you're a little concerned about how you're going to keep up with it and you know keep your cardiovascular shape and keep losing weight so that you're ready for football alright you know so gym class is one
331	c: who are some people that could help you figure out about this ?
115	t: i can just tell my mother there ain no because i don talk that much because i'm really shy to talk to my teachers or to people
308	c: oh you're you're serious about this and that's why you're actually coming in here and talking to me even though it's not really something you like to talk to people about very much
329	c: i really appreciate that you're being so open and you know i can tell you're here to to you know get your goal
306	c: you put the same kind of effort into football ?
309	c: that's impressive
312	c: so you said teachers so people like you know at school it's not really something that you you talk to them about the goal of the weight loss what about you know other people in your ? it's not something you want to talk about with your family like with your brother or with your mom or ?
306	c: why is ?
109	t: nothing i mean i'm nervous now because when i'm nervous i shake my leg just to calm me down because when i'm nervous i just keep on talking and talking like when you talk i wanna talk
312	c: it just kind of makes a noise and kind of to fill in some things
307	c: and so you know again we're kind of going back to this whole idea that you you want to be really losing weight for football so much so that you'll come in here and talk to me about something that's really hard for you to do
305	c: yeah you're that dedicated to it that says a lot about you know your personality and and how much you're willing to really put yourself out there to to get that goal yeah
307	c: but you know at the same time it's it's difficult to talk about it
305	c: well what would make it you know what would be helpful from ?
119	t: do you all have like some kind of gym in here that you could work out and ?
311	c: so if we had resources that you could come here during the wintertime and kind of keep up with your workout
302	c: not in this building necessarily but if you'd like i might be able to look up some resources and maybe give you a list of places that you could check out for how to stay active
310	c: and you know i wonder if talking to your mom about finding places to be active you know do exercise during the wintertime might be a way to get more ideas and stay active
304	c: but you did mention then you really don talk to your family about weight or tell them about your goals and things and so on the one hand you know you kind of don really want to talk to them about it and then on the other hand they they might be able to to help a bit if they had different ideas
305	c: but you're you know you need to kind of figure out what you want to do with that if anything
117	t: yeah
307	c: it's hard to think about talking about something that you haven talk to them about before
311	c: so it seems really that you'd like to -no that's okay you'd like to stay working on this goal on your own and not necessarily bless you and not necessarily talk to other people about it or you're thinking that that maybe you talk to some people in your family about it
112	t: i might coughs i might talk to my mom
328	c: so another idea that you kind of came up with is talking to your mom about it if you decide to so we talked a lot about activity and exercise and you're doing a lot of stuff there
307	c: take your time
328	c: lots of stuff's going around you ? do you need more ? alright so we've talked a lot about exercise and really you're doing a lot now two you know two hours a day and you mentioned some things that you're changing as far as eating
301	c: and a lot of times when i work with people sometimes you know what they'll do is they'll kind of pick something that they really want to work on when they leave here
305	c: would that be something that you'd want to talk ?
101	t: hmm i don know when i leave here i'm going to go home and rest my wrist
308	c: got to heal it up so you can get strong good plan
305	c: so your idea you know is when you leave is you really want to rest your laughs rest your wrist and in terms of really you know working on your weight loss what about you know something for ?
101	t: i don know
324	c: that was a big sigh oh i don know laughs hmm
307	c: sometimes it's really tough to think about you know what you're doing you're trying a lot of different things you want to find the right thing that works and can seem really overwhelming
302	c: sometimes when i work with people some people like to pick one little thing that they can do that's small but they're going to do it on a regular basis so they get really you know good at it that way and they'll just kind of chip away at the weight and other times when i work with people they you know really want to have like you know big goals or they want to you know lots of other things
305	c: and you know i'm not really sure where you fit in in all of that if you were to kind of want something that was smaller and that you can just kind of do a little bit at a time on a regular basis
345	c: you getting better or you getting ?
120	t: i'm getting better
307	c: that's good i'm glad you're getting better it's never any fun to be sick like that
325	c: so you're really not sure what you want to do when you leave alright
309	c: you're doing some great things
329	c: oh go ahead i'm sorry i didn mean to interrupt you
120	t: 0:19:49 move my hand
328	c: and you know you're not really quite sure what you want to work on you're doing a lot of activity right now at home and you've really seen some positive stuff in terms of your pants are getting smaller you're feeling like you're getting your speed really pushing it a little bit and you're also making some changes with the food in terms of having you know watching having a small snack and then waiting for for meals to do that so some positives here you know
306	c: what else do you want to add to ? coughs
117	t: nothing
329	c: coughs here i go
328	c: so really that kind of captures what you're doing right now and you're thinking about finding you know a way to stay active during the winter so you don want to lose what your your momentum here you want to get ready for football and possibly you know talking to your mom about ways to stay active during the wintertime
301	c: so during this actually you know you and i talk and then she and i are going to talk and then we'll come together kind of as a team you know how do you want me to share this idea that you know you're looking for something to do in the ?
117	t: 0:21:18 like we go to i'm not sure like i'm not sure how to tell her stuff we just 0:21:28
325	c: so you're not really sure how much i would tell her but i can you know i could just tell her
305	c: and to be honest with you it's up to you you know you tell me how much i can tell her and so it sounds like you wouldn mind if i just said you know you're looking for ways to stay active during the the wintertime
309	c: great
301	c: so i will talk to her about that and when we come back in together we'll kind of see if there's anything you know as a team you might want to work on when you leave
306	c: sound ?
117	t: okay
301	c: alright you want to switch ? okay let's go see what sarah and toya have from here do you need want to take any water with you or ?
