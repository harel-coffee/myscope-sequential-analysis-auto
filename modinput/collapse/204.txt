311	c: so she has been talking to you about weight and about eating
331	c: what kinds of things would you guys talk ?
112	t: we talked about like she want like she wanted me to like to start eating healthy because you can get bad blood pressure blood stuff like that and for sugar and stuff you can get diabetes too she had told me so i needed to start eating healthy and stop eating so much and exercise every day
311	c: so she's talking to you a lot about both the eating part and the physical activity part and doing the exercise
117	t: yes
307	c: and that wasn a lot of fun to talk to her about
112	t: it was fun a little bit because i learned something about that i can like have heart attacks and stuff from eating too much and getting too big have diabetes diseases and stuff so i mean you learn something from it and it was good
311	c: all right so you appreciate that she was helping you teaching you stuff
117	t: yes
308	c: and you learned so much that you remembered and could share it with me so you were really paying attention
117	t: yes
331	c: so a lot of stuff that kind of she was telling you that you needed to do with eating and with the activity what do you ?
112	t: i think i should start doing it
311	c: you're feeling like now's the time
106	t: 'cause since that talk we had last time when we had made that talk i was at 177 pounds but i got done talking with her i start exercising cutting on healthy stuff and i lost 24 pounds in two months
308	c: ooh making some big changes
117	t: mm-hmm

106	t: really i wasn as only i ate a lot of junk and pop like on my birthday and parties little parties we have and stuff and i just stopped drinking all that pop was eating food drinking v8 and fruit juice tomato juice stuff like that and all them hot chips and stuff i stopped eating those and eating the lay's potato chips and inaudible
313	c: so you're really substituting healthier foods
106	t: and i started exercising i joined the basketball team
309	c: hey hey cool
313	c: so you got more active
333	c: what position do you ?
308	c: oh very important position
117	t: mm-hmm
328	c: wow so you really saw some big weight change =
301	c: = when you started doing the nutrition and the activity stuff so you kind of said a few minutes ago that you think it's now it's time to start doing stuff and in fact you're already doing you're already doing stuff and i have to say that you know a lot of times when i meet with people they haven made as many positive changes as you have about their health already and so i kind of get to talk to them about nutrition or activity and you know a lot about both of those things
308	c: well i guess you know we have a chance now to talk about you know a few different things
305	c: and you also have experience with making the change so what would you like to talk about during this ?
117	t: uh  i don know like really
302	c: well i have i have some thoughts so maybe can i share those with you and you can let me know what you ?
117	t: yeah
308	c: 'cause you've made some really big cool changes with the food stuff
345	c: looking at as you all ?
109	t: mm-hmm i get a little nervous when i come to the doctor
329	c: well good thing i'm not a doctor huh phew
345	c: pretty comfy in here ?
117	t: mm
305	c: well you let me know if you're feeling nervous or if anything that we talk about makes you feel uncomfortable just be like "hey katie let's talk about something else"
117	t: okay
308	c: so you've made some really sweet changes like really with the stuff you're drinking =
302	c: and also the activity so sometimes when i meet with people they want to talk about you know like different things that they want to try doing like they've heard about like just some different thing with weight loss or a new activity or they want to hear more about different ways to eat we can talk about that stuff or we can really talk about what you're already doing right now and how well it's been working and talk about how you can kind of stick with that
112	t: we could talk about about the things i'm already doing
308	c: all right sweet things you're already doing
333	c: so tell me a little bit more about the eating stuff
106	t: so i really eat when we had that talk i told you i stopped eating all that junk and stuff i only eating like a couple times like might go to mcdonald's once in a while but not like over two times a week we been doing that and we start buy more vegetables really we been doing it for the whole family the whole household and then we our grandma be cooking steamed vegetables and all that really my sister and them don like them but i do they taste good she start going tomato juice i like that a lot with some salt and pepper in it real good and that's pretty much about the eating stuff
313	c: so everybody in the family's doing it but you're really taking off with it setting a good example
106	t: me and my grandma doing it really good
313	c: yeah so the two of you together are setting a great example for the rest of the family
117	t: mm
331	c: what makes you want to stay with eating those types of ?
106	t: i want to stay with it because i don even want to like get diabetes and all that and be worrying about like dying or having heart attacks and stuff so stick to what i'm doing
311	c: yeah so it's you know you don even want to have to worry about that scary stuff
117	t: yeah
313	c: stick with what you've got now
331	c: well you know tell me on a scale of like one to ten where one would be not at all important and ten would be so very very important how important is it for you to really stay with these food changes and the exercise stuff you're telling me ?
112	t: eight
311	c: it is important
331	c: so what makes it an eight and not a lower number like a six or a ?
112	t: 'cause i think we really should do it and not like do it like every single time don eat junk food like forever and ever but you know people are going to eat junk food a little bit and so i give it eight
313	c: okay so first of all like you were kind of talking about you and your grandma working together
106	t: mm-hmm playing biggest loser together on the wii all that we like doing activities like that
311	c: okay cool so a lot of support having fun too
117	t: mm-hmm
311	c: and it's just that idea that you don want to go crazy with nutrition or activity but seeing the positive stuff of making the small changes and staying with them is healthy
331	c: well what would it take to maybe bump you up a little higher on that scale to like a nine or a ?
115	t: it would take like eating healthy food a lot and only eating junk food like two times a really inaudible in-depth i like to get a little junk food every little now and then
310	c: so you're kind of thinking in terms of really seeing the amount of junk food that you're eating is related to what your weight is
312	c: and you're pretty happy with this idea of maybe a couple times a week like you mentioned going to the mcdonald's a couple times a week and anything less than that would be pretty extreme kind of out there not very much fun
117	t: yep
331	c: so if we went back to that that little scale on a scale of like one to ten and you said it's an eight it's important for you to keep up with the nutrition and activity what would bump you up on that importance ? what would make it more important for you to really stick with nutrition and activity keep up the things you're doing right ?
112	t: really 'cause in my family some people have died from like heart attacks and diabetes and stuff and i wouldn want to die i want to live my life for and so that will like take it to the inaudible eating total junk as total on vegetables and nutrition stuff
311	c: right sort of this idea of really your health protecting yourself and living a good life
309	c: about it all right cool
333	c: so tell me a little bit more about this basketball team
106	t: oh i play for the pharaohs inaudible really me and the coach get along well we go way back to my old school and it's fun went to the championship last year but now i'm fitting to start football and that including the exercise and stuff i do at this place called the 4h club i do exercises a little karate and stuff there and then i go to football practice then when i get home wash up inaudible healthy stuff and then for dessert i eat like a little ice cream or something
313	c: so every day you're being active going to 4h =
106	t: walk to school sometimes
311	c: and then when you get done with all your activities grandma's home and she kind of takes care of the food stuff for you make sure you got healthy things around to eat
117	t: mm-hmm
333	c: so what's going on with activity this ?

106	t: mm-mm i've been playing football before couple times
313	c: wow okay you're really getting involved with the sports
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: now a lot of times when i meet with people they put together a little bit of a plan would you want to take a look at how that might ?
117	t: okay
308	c: 'cause you're doing a ton of really positive things for your health
328	c: and seeing changes in your weight as a result of it and so you've actually mentioned quite a few things today in terms of the eating changes you made eating healthier at home subbing out certain foods but not going too crazy with it and then doing all of your activity
305	c: and you mentioned that you really kind of wanted to stick with what you were doing now because it was really working for you

106	t: trying to lose weight

313	c: okay all right well and now you mentioned some things that you wanted to do in terms of like you know you wanted to be healthy you want to lose weight
302	c: and a lot of times when i'm working with people you know i kind of find that making really specific goals like the smaller they are the more specific the more helpful they can be for some people
305	c: but that doesn mean that it's that way for you so what do you think in term of a ?
106	t: my goal is to like lose a lot of this fat this that's would be my goal
330	c: okay
119	t: write fill in there
301	c: well is this something you'd want to take home the written out ?

333	c: and what are you going to do to lose ?
106	t: exercise and eat healthy write that right ?
312	c: so you're not really sure where to put it on this as that's not very clear on this sheet is it yeah
305	c: well if it's something that you want to write anywhere on here you're welcome to but it's kind of it's up to you so we can do that or we can you know move on to another part of the plan
112	t: we can move on next time i come i can bring this back for you
312	c: okay so you're not really interested in actually filling out this idea of like the plan itself
112	t: not really i can do it at home and bring it back for you
311	c: okay so you're talking about kind of coming back in to see us
301	c: and just so you know this is actually the only time that we get to meet
308	c: as much as i'd like you to be able to come back in
324	c: that's a little ?
117	t: mm-hmm yes
307	c: bummer
305	c: well knowing that you're not going to be coming back is this something you'd like to work on with me now or do you have another idea of a time you'd like to work on ?
112	t: well other thing you could like talk like more things you think i haven mentioned about eating healthy talk about that
311	c: so you're interested in just a little bit more information
117	t: yes
328	c: all right so you had talked about making changes in your what you're drinking and what you're snacking on
331	c: and you have a lot of knowledge form the other stuff that you've been reading about the food so what have you been reading that kind of you know you want to talk about a little bit ?
119	t: about the food pyramid like is is it okay to like eat fried chicken and stuff ?
311	c: so you're wondering where different things fit fit in the food pyramid and if you had to try to find out how much or often you could have fried chicken
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: well what seems like a number to you that would be good for somebody who's trying to lose weight and be ?
119	t: two servings a week something like that
310	c: so sticking with kind of really watching how much you're eating of something with the servings
308	c: and you're using the right words like you know the stuff about the food guide pyramid because not everybody knows about the whole serving thing
331	c: well tell me a little bit more about a serving of like fried chicken
114	t: i think it's not that healthy i think it's okay a little bit
311	c: all right so you're saying fried chicken is definitely one of the foods that would be more of like a caution food not eat every day kind of food and you're absolutely right yeah
112	t: but the healthier chicken is baked yeah i like that one too i like both really
310	c: so you like a lot of really you know foods that taste good and are healthy for your body but you're still kind of looking at how to fit in foods that you like that aren as healthy for your body
117	t: yes
302	c: i have a little information in here about portion sizes you know what would be a serving would that be something you'd want to take a look ?
117	t: yeah
305	c: okay all right you can you can you know kind of let me know if it's something that you've seen before in all of your reading about nutrition and everything
119	t: 'cause when health specialist came to our school i saw this
327	c: so this is something that you learned about in school
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: all right well what catches your eye what do you like about ?
112	t: to likes it breaks it down far as like how big with the pictures and stuff how much servings you get
311	c: so it's helpful when you have something you can like you know real life that you can visualize
302	c: like a tennis ball or a baseball so meat is actually one thing you kind of just you asked me about the fried chicken would you want to talk a little bit more about how to look at the fried chicken in terms of using ?
112	t: hmm i understand that
311	c: you you said you =
112	t: yeah i do
331	c: and how does that help when you kind of think about your question of how much or how often to have the fried chicken =
112	t: this show me like it i understand it's like how really much you supposed to have really supposed to have in terms of health inaudible and portions
311	c: so it's yeah you're putting together it's that idea of how often you eat it along with how much you're having when you eat it
117	t: mm-hmm that's
308	c: well i think you just answered your own question about the fried chicken
305	c: i don know what do you think about ?
112	t: i think this really helped me by listing the portions
329	c: well that's great i'm glad this was a useful kind of thing to take a look at
302	c: there's other information in this in this folder and we don have to talk about all of it
301	c: we don have a ton of time left for us to talk so i'm going to have you switch places but if you'd like you can kind of just look at what's in here
305	c: because it sounds like you really like to read things and have an understanding i mean you know a lot about nutrition already
302	c: so you want to take a peek at what's in ?
119	t: we can do a little scan through
305	c: all right so again this gets boring say hey katie this is boring ?
119	t: it's not boring
305	c: okay but you'll let me know
302	c: so this is talking about the stuff about what you're drinking because just like you had already said that you'd made changes to what you're having to drink it gives you a little bit more information about different types of beverages so it's on this page and that page and it talks about you know having different choices and healthier choices
117	t: hmm
301	c: all right you ready for the next ?
117	t: mm-hmm
301	c: all right this one talking about healthy restaurant and fast food choices and in this column it gives you healthier choices and then in this column it gives you some unhealthier choices and it also gives you in parentheses the calories afterwards so this kind of helps you to see well if i were to choose a regular single patty hamburger without mayo or cheese it would be this many calories
306	c: it kind of keeps going on this page what do you see on here that might be ?
112	t: like things you could get on the pizza that would be healthy 'cause you could choose your toppings
311	c: yeah so how to kind of stay with eating something you like but also have healthier choices on the pizza
112	t: really with the pizza i know like regular with all that junk stuff pasta cream and butter inaudible all that it's like not that healthy but with this and the other you can it still looks good it looks like real good
311	c: so it's even though it says it's healthy doesn mean that it's not going to be a good food to eat
112	t: no yeah because like with regular just like this kind of pizza inaudible if you cut back you can still have fun eating it inaudible
311	c: so it's not you know that big of a deal to make little change and for you differently
302	c: all right so this one's talking about activity on how to kind of gives you an idea of how many minutes a day for a goal and how you might break it down between aerobics strength and stretching
106	t: yeah i like doing a little yoga on the wii too
313	c: yeah so you've even tried that out
106	t: mm-hmm it's pretty fun an the pushups and stuff on the wii on wii as i forgot what it's called
333	c: wii ?
117	t: yeah
313	c: yeah so there are some fun games on there
112	t: but still healthy even though they fun
302	c:  : and this page is talking about some resources around the detroit area for different classes on nutrition or activity
119	t: i went there before a couple times the boys and girls club
328	c: so you're really getting out and about and using a lot of stuff you mentioned doing different clubs before and playing sports
119	t: inaudible really learned a couple of things today
309	c: great so this wasn a complete waste of time
112	t: mm-mm i really learned some things learned things about eating right and healthy choices

112	t: things i get from mcdonald's and like pizza choices and different exercises and places you can go inaudible
311	c: so some of the physical activity stuff but really coming back to this idea of like you know healthy choices at like restaurants and fast foods
331	c: and something cool in all so when you you know go to restaurants and what's going to help you to maybe make a healthier choice as opposed to a choice that has more calories in it that might not fit your goal of weight ?
120	t: can you say that ?
307	c: it was kind of along question sorry
331	c: so when you're standing in line say at mcdonald's or something and you know maybe you're there with your family or there with all your friends or something you know why would you choose something that might be lower in calories and healthier as opposed to something that might be not as healthy but something that you really ?
112	t: so you could like have still have fun eating the thing still have it be a healthy and your friends might inaudible little something about you right
311	c: so it could still be fun to have something healthy
331	c: with all that nutrition knowledge that you have by coming here and being really involved in the conversation and reading the stuff that you get when you go to other places well what's something that your grandma could do to help you to stick with your goal of the weight loss and you know using some of the information that you learned here ?
