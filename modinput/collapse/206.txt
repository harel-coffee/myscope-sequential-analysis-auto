345	c: laughs so how's it ?
117	t: good
301	c: yeah so a lot of stuff with the paperwork and asking a lot of questions and this and that and you know came in here for the program
343	c: i just was wondering you know how do you feel about your ?
106	t: at first i wasn comfortable with it but then i started like exercising and walking it's like i dropped a couple of pounds
308	c: mm so you've had some success with losing weight
313	c: not everybody can make changes like that and see results so you actually were a little uncomfortable with your weight and decided to start doing some things
117	t: yeah
333	c: can you tell me a little bit more about ?
106	t: you know like i was like when in school i was thinking like this all the time come in here you know could lose a couple of pounds so like i have rotc and we go to the gym fridays and we exercise work out and stuff and then i catch the bus and then i walk a long way so they only have stairs at school so it helped me lose a lot of weight
313	c: okay so you're finding some stuff that you're already doing in terms of things at school and rotc is serious business there laughs you're working and then also kind of adding in a little of your own where you're doing some extra walking outside of school and you've seen some loss with that
112	t: mm-hmm even people noticed it too
328	c: yeah it feels good when people right notice it yeah so you have actually already made changes in terms of your exercise
302	c: and we have some time to talk more kind of about the exercise piece that you're working on and also you know talk if you want about the nutrition side of things the whole idea of kind of being with you know the nutrition and activity together for weight loss
311	c: and it sounds like you know you are kind of on board with continuing to work with towards losing weight
117	t: yeah
305	c: well what would you like to kind of talk a little bit more about ?
112	t: i don know more healthy foods that could eat because i don eat a lot of healthy foods that's it healthy foods and stuff and stuff in food like the sugar and stuff
328	c: all right so you really have the exercise piece so you're really having success with it are comfortable and are thinking about moving more in towards the eating side the nutrition side of things
117	t: yeah
309	c: yeah so i mean you're ready as you come ready to go here because you're being really honest with saying i don do a lot with healthy foods right now laughs but i'm willing to talk a little bit about it laughs
311	c: all right and you even mentioned some stuff about kind of understanding like sugars in foods and how to deal with that all right
331	c: so what ideas do you have about the healthy ?
112	t: need more fruits and vegetables and cut back down on the hot chips and fried chicken and french fries fast food just eat like the baked stuff and more fruits and vegetables and baked chips not like them fried hot chips
328	c: okay so it really is kind of you're able to say like this is what i'm doing right now and maybe there are some adjustments that i could kind of work towards in terms of more fruits as you know adding more stuff in more fruits and vegetables and then switching a couple of things like maybe less of the hot chips and maybe more of the baked chips less of the fried and maybe more of the baked things
308	c: so all like really smart ways that people can kind of like work on decreasing their calories in different things so you've got all the ideas going there
305	c: what would be something that would be kind of reasonable for you to think about actively working ? because again this really is your show i'm not here to tell you what to do
308	c: and you do have a lot of great ideas
112	t: inaudible and eating more healthy i don
311	c: so right now it's not something that you're doing but it's something you're thinking about doing
112	t: because senior year coming up and i got prom so gotta get in shape
328	c: you're looking forward to that going to get your dress and all that kind of good stuff yeah it's a big year coming up you want to get ready for it well again the nutrition piece and you've actually said some things about like the fast food and maybe making some adjustments there and then also things like baked instead of fried and adding more fruits and vegetables
302	c: so now i mean i have a little information about some nutrition things like making choices healthier versus unhealthier choices at fast food restaurants or some other stuff on beverages
305	c: which isn something that you really mentioned so that might not even work for you
302	c: or we could kind of just talk out some other things that you've mentioned stuff with sugars
106	t: i stopped drinking pop and inaudible juice i just be drinking a lot of water
328	c: so again i mean you're making both exercise and some nutrition changes with the changing pop and you know cutting down on some of the extra calories from juice and working on the water you know you mentioned that it's you're kind of looking for school and thinking about senior year
331	c: you know what other reasons are you making all these changes on your ?
120	t: can you repeat that
327	c: yeah well sure it wasn a very clear laughs
309	c: like i kind of just mean that you are you're already making all these really great change
328	c: and you said you've been noticing some changes in your weight and are thinking about senior year getting ready for all that good stuff
308	c: and i just you know was wondering you know what other reasons as because not everybody even though everybody has the stuff that's coming up they might not do what you're doing right now
331	c: so what are some of the reasons that you're really you know sticking with the exercise and seeing ?
112	t: from just stay in shape and fit the clothes to buy some clothes trey not to have diabetes like my daddy 'cause he got diabetes inaudible
311	c: so you've got some really personal reasons you know in terms of you know the clothes you gave me the real stuff and then also some health things that you see in your family yeah like you care about your dad a lot and you're thinking about your future and how you want to be healthy
309	c: smart stuff
328	c: okay so you have a lot of reasons right now that you are kind of having you stick with the exercise stuff and think about making as thinking about making eating changes
305	c: if you were going to pick maybe one or two small things to change about your eating what would those ?
112	t: i don know fried foods
329	c: can you say it again i didn hear you i'm sorry =
106	t: fried i'd stop eating probably the fried foods french fries and stuff and fast food probably don eat it like three days out of the week probably like once inaudible don eat it at all
313	c: okay so the two big things you really want to focus on are the fried and cutting back on those and also the fast food and you really are thinking maybe like less than three times a week maybe once or twice a week would be a good way for you to cut back on some of the calories from that
106	t: not back to back like one day and inaudible one day =
314	c: okay kind of spread it out
106	t: and eat more vegetables
117	t: yeah
332	c: what makes that one ?
312	c: so there aren a lot right now that you like to eat
331	c: so what types of vegetables do you enjoy ?
112	t: corn carrots string beans that's it
310	c: all right so you have three solid vegetables that you enjoy eating and other ones you're really not into
106	t: i eat squash
309	c: squash not a lot of people eat squash
310	c: laughs you know you mentioned a few times that you would like to add in some more vegetables in there and that there are some that you do like but there are some that you don you don like
109	t: green peas don like them
307	c: yeah that's fair
333	c: so if you were going to add in a vegetable or two how would you do ?
119	t: you say how would i do ?
330	c: mm-hmm
106	t: try to eat more and inaudible i don know
310	c: so you could eat more is as you know so it's interesting that you've definitely playing that whole that you know that there are certain vegetables that you don like and that you do like and just by a matter of eating more of the ones you do like you'd be upping your vegetable intake without having to force yourself to eat things you didn like to eat laughs
328	c: but other than kind of eating more of those you're not really quite sure what else you could do well i mean you've mentioned again a couple as you know the fried foods you've mentioned the fast foods and you've mentioned the vegetables as things that really you know if you're thinking of making nutrition changes what you'd like to do
302	c: and a lot of times when i work with people you know i kind of just have them focus on one that they think as or two things it's up to them that they think they're ready like to really focus on you know
305	c: what do you think would you really like to focus ?
112	t: the fried food
311	c: fried food okay all right so the fried foods all right
302	c: the paperwork here all right so i have kind of you know i have this sheet here in terms of sometimes writing things down is really helpful for people when they're trying to put a plan together
305	c: how would something like that work for ? go for ?
117	t: mm-hmm
311	c: okay all right so you have this idea of in terms of you know the fried foods and you know you've been really mentioning a lot of things specifically
308	c: that the best way to make changes and to think about things is really how you've already been doing them
328	c: the exercise you do this on fridays you walk a little bit further you know your times and this and that so you're really specific about your changes that you've already made
333	c: so what specifically would you want to do with the fried ?
106	t: cut it down stop eating a lot of fried chicken and french fries and stuff eat more baked food
305	c: okay would you like to write or would you like me ?
119	t: you can
305	c: you as okay all right so how should i write ?
106	t: lower the fried foods
313	c: all right so you really have this idea that you want to eat less of the fried
333	c: and how do you want to do ?
106	t: like eat more baked food and tell mom don fry instead of frying the chicken bake the chicken
313	c: okay so number one change to eat baked and number two to talk to your mom about how she's making the foods
117	t: yeah
305	c: okay and i should write it talk to her about baking instead of ?
117	t: mm-hmm
306	c: anything else ?
313	c: you're really focusing on this idea of you know making the change out with the fried
331	c: so why why do you want to do this ?
112	t: because fried food is not healthy can get high blood pressure problems and diabetes problems
331	c: what ?
112	t: to keep my weight down
302	c: all right cool all right so the next part really talks about this idea that sometimes there are things that get in the way of our plans
344	c: so what are some things that you know might kind of stop you from lowering the fried foods that you're ?
109	t: my momma might still fry the chicken
344	c: okay so that's what as okay what ?
109	t: like if i go to my daddy house they might buy fried chicken from the fast food inaudible
326	c: all right so how should i write that just you know there might be fried foods at your dad's house
109	t: or at school too
326	c: those are the two big ones
308	c: you're kind of as you know you're really thinking about like kind of all your as all the places you could go
333	c: so it's actually really impressive that you're not thinking like just at home or just at so and so you're covering all all the places that things could go so what are some ideas that you have if your mom still decides to fry the chicken even after you ask her to bake ?
106	t: probably just eat one piece that's the only thing to do inaudible
313	c: so eat a little bit less in the portion size
106	t: less
323	c: so eat as now when i said less you seemed to kind of agree with it more would you like me to write down eat less or eat one piece instead of three ?
106	t: eat less
313	c: eat less all right so eat less of the food
117	t: mm-hmm
333	c: what ?
106	t: for school if there's fried food i just bring my own lunch
328	c: ooh so wait a minute all right so you're kind of thinking that if there are fried foods at home or at your dad's house you could just have less of the foods like just have one piece and work on that and then otherwise at school pack your own lunch all right
305	c: and what is the first step that you can take in order to reach your goal of lowering the fried ?
106	t: first thing i do is talk to my mom and my father about the fried foods in the house make it less
309	c: so you're going straight to the big thing right
326	c: you just want to talk them about it and see what they have to say and so you could talk to them about having less fried foods and you're really not sure what they're going to say to that yeah that's kind of that big unknown
301	c: yeah you know we have some time you know where i do talk to your mom and then we talk together at the end of the session would that be something that you would want to talk to her about ?
117	t: yeah
345	c: what do you think she'll ?
324	c: ? laughs
326	c: this is a new as so this is really kind of something new that you're thinking about doing and it sounds like it's a pretty big change from how the rest of your family eats which might make it pretty tough if they're sitting around really enjoying you know the chicken and things and you're eating a little differently
333	c: so how might that go if you're over at your dad's and they come in with ?
106	t: that's a good question inaudible find something to eat besides fried food
313	c: so you'll just try to get out of there so you're kind of really thinking about how you can help yourself to stay on track with your weight loss goals you know so your number one idea would be just to talk about it right away but you're not sure what they're going to do so you have a plan b as well
117	t: uh-huh
302	c: you know i have i have a little information about how to kind of decrease the calories in the fried chicken would it be all right if i kind of shared it with ?
117	t: mm-hmm
305	c: and let me know if you've already heard it
302	c: because you know but sometimes people will take the skin and the breading off of the chicken and that can kind of cut a good amount of the calories
306	c: what do you think of ?
112	t: good
325	c: so it kind of i mean so to you it kind of makes sense that by taking that off you'd be getting down on the calories but in terms of actually going and doing that that might not be the choice that you would make
305	c: well i mean that's fair like i said it was just a little piece of information and you don have to do anything with it if you don want to
313	c: your idea is really to have just like the one full piece instead of having more of the pieces
117	t: mm-hmm
324	c: when i said that you got kind of quiet laughs
329	c: and i think you think it's a pretty wacko idea maybe laughs
117	t: mm
313	c: well what you know you've already really kind of said that you were interested in talking to your mom and your dad about the fried foods and everything in the house
302	c: and this last one really is something that your mom because she's the person that's here with you could do to help you with your goal
112	t: she can start lowering the fried chicken and stuff in the house
331	c: stuff
112	t: french fries and grease
311	c: all right so she could kind of cut back on certain things that are around the house and then it just wouldn be the only thing that people were eating
302	c: but you know sometimes people like to say what they would you know like substituted would that be something that would be helpful for ? or you don think would that be something that would be helpful for her like if you were to say like oh instead of doing this i'd really like this kind of stuff
305	c: i don know i don know if that would work or not you know your home and what your mom will say and stuff so
112	t: yeah that work
311	c: so that would work
333	c: so what would be some things that you would suggest as substitutions that you'd like to ?
112	t: baked foods
306	c: all right all right so kind of taking a look at your plan here what do you ?
112	t: good
301	c: that you like it and you know when your mom comes in i can either kind of share this actual paper with her or maybe talk to her more about what we talked about or you know i can kind of just not talk to her about this kind of stuff so what would you ?
117	t: not
312	c: not so you don really want her to see this
117	t: mm-mm laughs
305	c: okay so what would you as how would you like me to kind of bring up this idea that you you'd like to have lower fried foods in the ?
112	t: just talk about healthy stuff like fried food is not good to eat more healthy baked food than fried food
311	c: okay so kind of just maybe give her some information about you know the importance of weight management and decreasing fried foods
117	t: mm-hmm
313	c: all right and then you talked about wanting to talk to her about you know kind of asking her what she would think about decreasing the fried foods when we were together
301	c: so if it's all right with you when we do come in together i'll just kind of give you a chance to bring up some stuff and you know all right so i won show her this but before you leave i you know i'll make a copy of it so you have it to take home
117	t: okay
306	c: ? and would it be helpful at all to you to practice what you would say to your mom in terms of the fried ?
117	t: mm-hmm
330	c: yeah all right so i'm your mom pretend okay
112	t: mom i figured out that fried food is not healthy and we eat it a lot at home and we should eat more baked food than fried food instead of you frying chicken and pork chops and stuff should bake then be healthier
330	c: so it's healthier but everybody really likes the fried foods
307	c: that would be tough if she said something like that it would be tough
117	t: yeah
326	c: yeah and you're thinking she might say something like that because everybody does
331	c: hmm so i mean what could you say or what reasons could you give her ?
112	t: sorry eat more healthier fried food is not that healthy for you baked food is really better than the fried foods
311	c: so really going back to that idea of health and that you said even baked goods can taste as baked foods can taste good and stuff
309	c: okay so it sounds like you've got some reasons to back yourself up with why you want this to happen
117	t: mm-hmm
305	c: anything else you want to practice ?
308	c: cool well i have to say you really presented it well in terms of like why you wanted to do it and your reasons around it and all that stuff so you seem really prepared for that cool
117	t: inaudible
331	c: well if you were to you know i guess on a scale of one to ten where one is not at all confident and ten is extremely confident how confident are you that you can really cut down on the fried ? what number would you ?
112	t: three
311	c: a three okay so you know you're feeling a little confident about it
331	c: what made you a three and not a ?
112	t: just i'm a little confident about it by me i'm not
310	c: so you're still feeling a little two ways about you know going for cutting down on the fried foods
117	t: mm-hmm
332	c: and what are the you know what are the things that aren that great about the cutting down on the fried ?
115	t: fried foods are good but it's not good for your health
325	c: so they taste good but you're really thinking about your health and your weight and kind of those long term things yeah
331	c: so what would it take to bump you up a couple ?
112	t: lower lower the fried food and will my mom help
328	c: okay so you would feel more confident number one if you did it already you kind of like tried it out and see how it went just kind of similar to the exercise stuff like you tried it out and you're seeing that you're doing it and it's you know how it's going is not so bad and then number two if you had support like if your family was kind of behind you for it too cool all right good
306	c: all right well anything else that you'd like to change on this or bring up or ?
117	t: no
301	c: okay all right cool well if it's okay with you then i'll just have you guys switch places and like i said when you come back in you know we'll just kind of summarize and i'll give you a chance to talk to your mom if you want to bring up this stuff
117	t: okay
301	c: okay well annette and i had a chance to you know talk a little bit
