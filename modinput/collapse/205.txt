301	c: = we'll get started and capri i'll have you go ahead and hang in here with me for just a little bit
345	c: all right lady how you ?
117	t:  fine
301	c: so lots of stuff today in the questionnaires about nutrition and activity and things like that
343	c: i just want to know how do you feel about your ?
101	t: i don know
312	c: it's not really anything you've thought about before
106	t: just my mom be like when we go and walk around the track
311	c: so your mom's been talking to you about it for a little bit
112	t: some sometimes
311	c: all right and so she's the only person that will talk to you about your weight
112	t: like my sister do sometimes but to eat better stuff like that
311	c: so other members of your family talk to you about it
331	c: well what kinds of things do they say about your ?
112	t: they just said i need to eat better mostly they don say nothing inaudible they just say i need to eat better
328	c: so it's not like they're saying anything about the way that you look but they're kind of suggesting a little bit more you're going walking with your mom =
112	t: inaudible hamburgers
311	c: so some substitution and some nutrition things so other people are talking to you about that stuff
312	c: and as far as what you think about your weight it's really not anything that bothers you right now
112	t: sometimes not all the time
311	c: so every once in a while
331	c: tell me a little bit more about the times that it bothers you what's going ?
117	t: i don know
310	c: really can think of anything off the top of your head right now and when it does bother you it's not really one specific thing
329	c: some of my questions are a little bit weird
302	c: well i have some information about what's called your body mass index or your bmi would that be something you'd want to take a look at i could ?
324	c: and you're not sure
305	c: and that's okay this really is kind of your time to talk a little bit about nutrition and activity and weight and weight loss and you get to kind of pick what you want to talk about and you can always say like "hey katie this is boring" or "hey katie you know i don want to talk about this let's talk about something else"
306	c: fair ?
117	t: mm
302	c: so would you want to take a look at that stuff under body mass ?
312	c: t: i don know
310	c: well you're not you're still not quite sure on what the info is and maybe if i give you a little bit more information about what i'm talking about it will make more sense
302	c: your body mass index or your bmi it's actually a measure of somebody's height to their weight and it lets you know what your disease risk is in relation to your weight
306	c: what do you think about hearing something about ?
324	c: still not really sure if you want to hear about it
305	c: well what would you like to talk about since we have some time in terms of nutrition and activity and weight ?
324	c: really no ?
101	t: no
302	c: well sometimes when people come in and talk to me they talk to me about stuff that they're already doing or that they've heard their families talk about like changes in nutrition or being more active and other times they look at some information that i have and they get some ideas from there
324	c: still not quite sure which one of those would be a good idea
305	c: well like i said this is really kind of your show
301	c: so i can either get out some of the paperwork and we can look through that and we can talk about the body mass index stuff or you can just kind of hang out and you can just kind of share with me what's been going on with the stuff in your family with the food stuff and activity
324	c: you really don want to be here
117	t: yeah
331	c: well what made you come in and see me ?
301	c: your mom just dragged you in now you're stuck in a room with me and on a camera and you just really are thinking "what the heck is going ?
331	c: well tell me a little bit about what you know about the nutrition stuff about eating healthy eating
119	t: fruits and vegetables
308	c: ooh so you've got some stuff in there i've got a feeling
331	c: come on what about the fruits and ?
324	c: not really something you want to talk ? so you're shrugging your shoulders a lot what does this ?
328	c: so don really want to hear anything about the body mass index and you've got some ideas about the healthy eating like the fruits and vegetables and your family does talk to you about the healthy things and you go on walks with your mom but what kinds of stuff
345	c: what else do you do with your ?
120	t: go places go out places inaudible
327	c: so you guys just have a chance to hang out
313	c: and sometimes when you go you do things that are active like you go for walks with her
106	t: i usually ride my bike while she walk around a little bit or she ride my bike and then i'll walk or we both walk 'cause she don like bikes too much
313	c: so you try to find a way to do stuff that you like and she likes doing sometimes you ride sometimes you walk around
331	c: what do you like about doing those bikes and ?
112	t: walking and i like riding my bike
311	c: just a fun way to spend your time
345	c: well what have you heard that people do if they wanted to lose ?
119	t: go to the gym drink smoothies i don know eat better
327	c: so a combo of like being more active they do exercise and they eat differently
308	c: so you just named the two biggest healthy ways that people go about losing weight not everybody knows that stuff right off the top of their head that's pretty impressive
345	c: so what are some reasons that people want to lose ?
119	t: 'cause they too big don like the way they look
327	c: so it really is this idea of what they look like and how they kind of feel inside their body
119	t: how other people think they look like
327	c: so what other people are telling them not necessarily how they feel
302	c: so sometimes for those people it's kind of hard because if they feel okay and other people are telling them that they should do certain things it's not really fun might not be fun for them so i have a little information about extra weight and when people are in overweight status would that be something you'd want to hear ? so there you know is this idea that a lot of times there are certain health problems that can develop when people re overweight and things like they can have problems with blood pressure and problems with things like developing diabetes as they get older
306	c: what do you think about that kind of stuff in terms of you know if people are you know have a weight ? so this is new info not something you've heard ?
307	c: and it can be kind of scary to think about you know having a disease because of the way that as you know what you weigh
301	c: so what should we talk about during our ?
324	c: you're still pretty unsure about you know what we're supposed to be doing in here and don really want to talk to me much about it
311	c: well so if you because you've you know heard some things from your mom and your sister about nutrition and activity and wanting to eat healthier and doing that
332	c: and if if you don do any of that what do you see going on in about five years from ? how about you'll be 17 years old high school
112	t: me losing weight
331	c: you'll be losing ?
112	t: mm-hmm because i won need nobody to take me nowhere and i have to do it on my own so i will be able to do it on my own
311	c: so other people telling you what to do and how to lose weight isn the way you want to do it
112	t: well i'm talking about like jogging 0:15:579 everywhere like i can go to places by myself instead of with everybody else
311	c: you'll be in more control of what you're doing
331	c: what kind of places will you go ? you got your car what kind of car is ? any car no special car just some ? so you got your keys and you got your car and you see yourself you know when you got those things you see yourself losing weight tell me a little bit more about that
310	c: there's some places that you'll be able to go when you're 17 and you have your own car and license that you can go right now those will help you with losing weight
112	t: i wasn thinking about a car i was thinking about walking around instead of driving my mom said she would buy me a car when i turn 16
310	c: but you're not sure if you want a car when you're 16
345	c: what would you like when you're ?
311	c: 'cause you mentioned thinking about walking around
120	t: i know when i'm 16
312	c: well it almost sounds like it's this idea that you know if you get in the car you're not going to be as active 'cause you won be walking around
120	t: unless you move the gas pedal and brake back and forth back and forth
311	c: and you don see yourself losing much weight if you're driving more instead of doing the walking around
331	c: so what makes you want to be losing weight when you get ?
112	t: because i'm too big
311	c: so getting smaller is something that you'd like to do
114	t: but not too small because i don like being small i'd rather be big than small
311	c: so don mean too small finding that balance
333	c: well how do you think you'll get ?
112	t: by losing weight
311	c: so you know yeah losing weight
333	c: what types of things do you want to do to lose weight to get ?
112	t: riding around on my bike roller-skating eating better
311	c: so you have some ideas about the food again and the activity stuff
302	c: i have some information on the activity stuff since you're bringing that up want to take a ? so here's one of the handouts is in here
323	c: something on here surprising ?
119	t: they said 20 minutes don you supposed to go longer than 20 minutes 'cause 20 minutes can do much
311	c: so you've actually heard some stuff about how much activity you're supposed to do like how long it's supposed to last
106	t: my mom said the doctor told her 30 minutes we usually go about an hour and a half around the track jogging or walking hour and a half
311	c: so this is something that you know you've actually heard stuff about like spending a half an hour
313	c: and you're not you know just spending half an hour you're going for three times like an hour and a half you went around
333	c: how often do you do ?
106	t: maybe three or four times a week
313	c: so it sounds like you have a pretty steady schedule doing that
345	c: you want to go out ?
120	t: ?
345	c: you want to go out ?
120	t: there's not nothing to do out there
327	c: it's kind of boring in here isn it
331	c: so what makes you go to the track three or four times a week =
112	t: to walk to run jog like to go to the playground and play but i don get to do that 0:22:149 my friends
328	c: so it's one way for you to just kind of do things and also going to the playground with your friends is another thing you like to do so you have a pretty steady schedule of going few times a week to the track and you even noticed that this idea of the 20 minutes of stretching isn you know isn going to do anything it's not enough to really see changes in health and weight you're doing more than that and even the goal of doing 60 minutes every day building up to 60 minutes every day on the days you go to the track you're doing more than that
331	c: so what are the things what are some of the things you like about going to the ?
120	t: there's nothing you can do there except walk around
311	c: so it's not that exciting to be there so you might as well do some activity
331	c: what makes you go do activity when you you know before you decided as
309	c: you're pretty good at eye circles
307	c: doing pretty as oh i hope i didn as i didn want to embarrass you by saying that
345	c: doing those things probably help you stay less bored and stay awake when you're talking to ?
120	t: no just inaudible
329	c: say it again i didn even hear you i'm sorry =
120	t: i just did them inaudible
305	c: no big deal keep going if you'd like
313	c: so right now you're doing about three or four days a week of going to the track
333	c: how long have you been doing that ?
106	t: about maybe two months because i've been in school a few months
313	c: so it's been a pretty you know solid period of time that you've been doing it and you're going with people in your family when you go to the track
333	c: who do you go ?
112	t: my mom sometimes my sister and my nephew my nephew go every time he over to our house
327	c: so he really likes to go
120	t: and ride his bike he only three though so he can just like ride his bike around the track
328	c: so he's little but you've got a lot you know him he's there your mom sometimes your sister people to go with and they're really isn anything fun about going it's just kind of boring so you go and you do some activity and you go home
331	c: so if there's really nothing fun that's going on when you're there why do you ?
112	t: 'cause my mom go 'cause my mom will go inaudible nothing else to do at home pretty much inaudible and ride my bike i would rather ride my bike there than at home up and down the street
311	c: so number one your mom kind of says "okay we're going and" =
112	t: no she says she's going and she asks me do i want to go i say yes most of the time because i don like staying at home or riding my bike up and down the street and around the corner
311	c: so it gets you tout of the house and it's fun to go up there and take your bike
305	c: and it's not even that she's making you go you decide that you want to go
331	c: so you know on a scale of like one to ten where one is not at all important and ten is very very very important how important is it to you to go to the track like that on a regular basis =
119	t: to lose weight or go to the ?
305	c: so you kind of want to see the difference if the question was asking about losing weight or going to the track
112	t: going to the track seven i'll say but i'll say losing weight i'll say maybe a nine nine or ten
311	c: so just going to the track to go to the track i mean you're up there and it's kind of important when you put it into losing weight you're up you know to nine it's darn close to very very very important it's up there
331	c: what makes it a nine and not a lower number like a ?
112	t: because i be proud i don want to be skinny i just want to lose weight not skinny
312	c: so you know getting rid of this idea of you know you don want to be skinny but you do =
112	t: i don want to be big either you want to be in the middle
311	c: you want to be in the middle and going to the track and doing the activity is one way that you can work to get smaller but not too small
308	c: pretty smart in there in terms of getting in your regular physical activity
331	c: what would it take to bump you up to a ?
112	t: losing weight
310	c: so actually seeing some results you haven seen any yet
116	t: well i don think 'cause i don have no scale inaudible scale you know and the other one said inaudible that's where i mostly be at on the weekends it's boring at my house and go and walking the dogs
313	c: so you're finding ways to be active even when you're not at home you know when you're over at other people's houses and things
311	c: and if you if you had a way to like you said a scale at home or other places that you could kind of keep track of your weight you might like that a little bit more because then you would know so you'd see results that you have
333	c: well how do you how do you go about like getting a scale at home if that was something that you wanted to =
106	t: buy it i guess buy it or tell mom to buy it inaudible
310	c: so you could ask your mom to get that for you if you want but you're not really sure if having a scale is you know going to be the way that you want to see if you're losing weight or not
331	c: but what are some other ways that you could tell if it was ?
309	c: because you're absolutely right
302	c: like a lot of times when people are trying to see how they're doing they weigh themselves almost every day just to see if what they're doing =
112	t: maybe weigh themselves they should weigh themselves maybe once every two weeks 'cause if you keep on weighing yourself you going to think you're not losing no weight
311	c: so you're thinking that if it's too close together it's going to be too small but if you're waiting for long enough then you'll see differences then
302	c: and so i got as i have some info on the weighing stuff want to hear ?
345	c: because people who who are doing changes to help themselves lose weight like being active or making changes to their eating habits if they weigh themselves it's a really great way for them to keep track oh do you want to take care of ? i can =
120	t: no i was telling this
345	c: oh you're on a ?
120	t: yes i mean no well i supposed to go inaudible i was supposed to went to the doctor today inaudible go to a party at 5:00 inaudible
301	c: so you want to get to a party so we should see about =
345	c: = wrapping things up ?
120	t: no 'cause my mom would be mad
301	c: okay so without kind of you know saying to your mom "now i know you have to go to a party so we should get you out of here" we should see about getting out of here soon if we can
328	c: huh well we were talking about the weighing the scale stuff and i think i had said that people that weigh themselves have you know that's a really great way for people to tell if what they're doing is working or not then they can make adjustments from there
308	c: so your idea of looking at a scale and seeing feedback is pretty cool and pretty smart in terms of checking yourself for the weight loss
328	c: you mentioned that you could ask your mom for a scale if you wanted to get one
120	t: inaudible
327	c: oh sorry
331	c: what would she say if you asked her for a ?
115	t: inaudible just say yes she might say no
310	c: so she would probably say yes and now you're saying that being able to kind of see weight loss would help you bump up to that really very very very important of keeping you going on the track for that
325	c: but you're not quite sure if you want to ask her or not about the scale
116	t: probably better not because i don want inaudible and if i did want to weigh myself i wouldn want to spend it just go and buy one because i'm not going to hardly use it so i just go along because like on the weekends when i go over there i could use his scale or use my auntie's scale inaudible
311	c: so you're being real i mean you know you don need one at home you have one over at your uncle's to weigh yourself at and they don mind you using that whenever you go over
117	t: no
302	c: but you know sometimes people when they're weighing themselves they write down what they weigh that helps them keep track of things
306	c: how would that work for ?
310	c: you don really want not interest in writing down what you weigh
114	t: i am but  just
325	c: there's something about it that's stopping you
114	t: no i'm just
311	c: so you're interested in writing down what you weigh
120	t: i know i  0:35:349 forget her name
345	c: toya or ?
120	t: sara i think sara i think it was inaudible i was wrong
345	c: ?
119	t: oh no it was sara she inaudible she took my weight
311	c: so you do know what you weigh right now
114	t: no because i didn look at it i didn look at it i don want inaudible but i did but i didn look because i didn know if it would change the numbers inaudible
301	c: so you were going to look at your weight but it wasn there for long enough for you to grab it well if that's something that you would like to know before you go just let me know and we can find out write it down for you if you want
120	t: what is my mom ?
301	c: she's probably just waiting for you doing the taste test
324	c: you're kind of getting ready to move on with this done talking with ? oh okay yeah yeah
302	c: well sometimes when people meet with me they'll do something called will make a little plan in terms of either what they want to do to lose weight or what they're thinking about doing for losing weight some ideas that they have
328	c: and we talked about some stuff today in terms of your doing activity about three or four times a week you know you're thinking about maybe weighing yourself kind of to keep track and see what's going on
306	c: you know what would your plan ? or something that you would be thinking about doing to keep up with your goal of weight ? you're thinking about ?
116	t: not sure
310	c: so you're not really you're not really sure what it is that you want to do
112	t: i know i want to lose weight
310	c: you know you want to lose weight you just don know how you want to do it
112	t: i know i want to do it on the exercise instead of as on the exercise and eat right not taking that no something they have on tv with the packets i like the packets with the stuff that you put inside of the water inaudible
311	c: so you're talking about you know losing weight a healthy way in terms of making changes to eating and activity not the stuff on tv that's easy and little quick plans but you do like the little flavored water packets
310	c: not something that you're thinking about getting
331	c: well who's somebody that could help you with losing ?
112	t: my mom
311	c: your mom all right
331	c: and what could she ? like what's something that we could kind of talk to her about when we're together that would be helpful for you in terms of losing ?
101	t: i don know
310	c: so you don really have any ideas it's just easier if she kind of tells you what she what she thinks that you should do and you're cool with that all right so you're looking for her ideas
301	c: all right you want to go ahead and switch with your ? okay cool all right so we'll kind of come back and we'll have you switch places and then we'll come back in
