330	c: hi i'm sylvie
117	t: i'm kiera
309	c: hi nice to meet you okay
301	c: alright so they probably told you that we're going to be videotaping these sessions because part of what we're trying to learn is just sort of the best way to talk to people about weight and things like that
306	c: any questions about the videotaping or ?
117	t: no
305	c: okay the other thing i wanted to just start out by saying is that this might be a little different than other times you've talked to people about weight because i'm not really here to tell you what to do or to say you have to follow this diet i'm really here to figure out what if anything you know you want right now for your life
306	c: does that make ?
117	t: uh-huh
343	c: okay so i guess i'd like to just get started by kind of finding out your perspective and you know sort of why you're here and what you think about your your weight right now and your health
112	t: i need to lose it
311	c: okay so you think you need to lose it okay
331	c: tell me more about that
112	t: i just i'm just big like and i need to lose it because something like it's unhealthy and stuff
311	c: okay so you're worried that where you're at right now isn a healthy weight okay
117	t: i really don know just
325	c: okay you're not really sure exactly kind of where you need to be you just know that you want to drop a little bit
117	t: yeah
331	c: okay and is this something that you've thought for a long time or is this sort of a new thing you're thinking about or something ?
112	t: for a long time
311	c: okay so this is something that for a while now you've wanted to lose weight
333	c: what kinds of things have you ?
106	t: like i go walking every day with my mom
313	c: okay so you've been working on getting more physical and you walk every day
117	t: yes
309	c: alright well that sounds like a pretty big commitment
333	c: mm-hmm the walking how long have you been doing ?
106	t: for like a while
333	c: okay and i imagine there was a time when you weren walking
106	t: well we moved downtown like two months ago and we started walking around and seeing what's around and stuff so
311	c: being in a new environment was helping and it sounds like maybe being out of school was that part of it too
117	t: yes
333	c: in terms of ? were you walking when you were in school or was it only when you
106	t: it started when i got out of school
313	c: okay okay so summertime and being out downtown and now it's sort of starting to get to be a habit of just something that you do every day okay
333	c: and tell me more about the walking is it you know whether you know how long or you know whether you notice yourself out of breath or getting hot or
109	t: i be hot a little bit but i still walk like we walk a lot of places like a couple we'll be out there probably like two hours or so
313	c: okay so two hours just sort of walking around from place to place but you do it every single day okay
309	c: well that sounds like a pretty you know like i said a pretty good start
331	c: have you noticed any weight changes since then or maybe you didn really know where you were at to begin ?
114	t: i didn know where i was at
307	c: okay so it's so it's really hard to tell how much that's helping you right now with the weight loss although obviously being physical has a lot of other benefits</text>
117	t: hmm like i don know
307	c: you're not sure that you've noticed any anything different since you've started walking
117	t: not really
302	c: okay so some people find that they have more energy some people find that they get stronger some people find that they're more relaxed or feel better
112	t: 0:04:30 like relaxed and feel a little better
311	c: okay so you so for you it's more the like relaxing and just kind of emotionally feeling better when you walk
109	t: not really i really didn think
328	c: okay so for you numbers is just not really what you're looking at you just want to drop some weight and feel better because you want to be healthier and you've already made some changes
117	t: yes
333	c: so you know given that losing weight has to do with cutting you know calories that you eat and getting more physical what kinds of things have you thought about adding sort of to what you're doing right ?
112	t: more fruit and vegetables and stuff like that
311	c: okay so you've already identified something that you'd like to do which is eating more fruits and vegetables
103	t: i don know that's just basically like only food i like don really eat vegetables and fruits every single day
314	c: okay so you've noticed that that while occasionally you eat fruits and vegetables it's not something you eat every day and so instead you end up eating things that maybe have more calories
112	t: i can like eat more salads than i do
329	c: i'm sorry i didn hear that
112	t: that i can like eat more salads and stuff
311	c: more salads and ? okay so so having healthier meals instead of eating higher calorie foods or maybe fast food i don know
117	t: yes
305	c: if that's something that you that you do that you'd replace it with salads
112	t: kind of both
311	c: a little bit of both
117	t: yeah
328	c: you do okay so it's not just an idea that someone told you this is something you actually really enjoy okay
308	c: well it sounds like you already have some pretty good goals for yourself so maybe we should just talk about you know how how to get that started
328	c: you've already made changes with the walking and it seems like you're pretty confident about keeping that up and now you'd like to make some changes with your nutrition eating more fruits and vegetables and replacing high fat and high calorie meals with salads are sort of two areas that you think would make a big difference
344	c: okay so so what's getting in the way of of of making that ?
112	t: nothing really just gotta get up and do it
311	c: okay so it's sort of you just have to sort of set your mind to it is one part of it and you mentioned get up and do it
303	c: i mean making salads does take a little bit of work instead of just grabbing something
302	c: mm-hmm so some kinds find it helpful to like when you said just get up and do it like to make a plan to write down a plan that they can keep with them and other kids prefer to just talk about it
305	c: what would you ?
112	t: to write it down
313	c: okay so i'll give this to you so your plan is to you've said three things you said keep up the walking add fruits and vegetables and replace have salads for some of your meals okay so those are three things that you've come up with to help with the weight
331	c: okay and why do you want to do these three ?
112	t: so i can be healthy
305	c: okay so for you your health is really important to you
344	c: and what kinds of things do you see that might get in the way of your plan of starting to make these changes ?
112	t: none
311	c: there's nothing that would get in the way right now that you can envision nothing stopping you from moving ahead
302	c: okay can i throw out some things that maybe get in the way for other kids and you can see if any of them ? one is that they have to have those things around the fruits and vegetables
117	t: yeah
103	t: because like we have food in the house just don like eat it
311	c: okay so it's really for you just about motivation and kind of getting going okay but having them around is not a problem your mom has fruits and vegetables
344	c: okay what about the the effort it takes to make the ? is that something that might get in the ?
112	t: not really like i just set my mind to it i'll i can do it
309	c: you're you're the kind of person that when you set your mind to something you do it
313	c: like the walking it's just a matter of getting into a habit
344	c: okay and what about when school ? you know the walking and those things
112	t: yeah i can do it like i can when i come home do my homework and go for a walk
313	c: okay so maybe that's something we could put that if school laughs gets in the way you're going to do it after homework
117	t: mm-hmm
344	c: and some i'm just wondering when it starts to get dark out is you know what are your thoughts about walking you know
106	t: me and mom we walk like it's not really dark but we go walk when it's getting down
313	c: okay so we can ask your mom about walking with you even during the school year so that you don have to walk alone at night okay that sounds like a plan
344	c: what do you think has stopped you from making these changes before ?
119	t: nothing really just you know
311	c: just getting your motivation up there
117	t: yeah
333	c: okay so on a scale from one to ten where ten is that you're completely ready to get going right now and one is you're not at all ready and five is sort of it's somewhere in the middle what number would you say you're ?
106	t: ten
313	c: you're at a ten you're you're like today is the day that you're getting started
331	c: okay and why a ten and not a lower ?
106	t: because i'm ready to do it
313	c: you're ready to do ?
331	c: inaudible what is your thought what are your thoughts about why what made today ?
117	t: i don know it's just
331	c: was it coming here getting on the ?
112	t: probably
331	c: okay i'm wondering if getting on the scale was motivating for you is that something you can keep doing to keep your motivation ?
117	t: yeah
311	c: you feel like you could do that so maybe that's something you know if motivation gets in the way you can get on the scale to kind of say hey i need to keep doing this
302	c: and just if it's okay can i give you a little bit of information about weighing yourself ?
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: so weighing yourself every day is a great way to monitor how you're doing and also can see you know like whether or not you're any of these things are working or whether you need to do more but you also have to realize that weight goes up and down every day
117	t: okay
306	c: what do you think about ?
112	t: yeah i can think about that too
310	c: you can think about like kind of taking a week of weight you know like weigh yourself every day but look at the whole week instead of just like
307	c: oh god look at what happened today you know
302	c: okay i just want to make sure because sometimes you know kids can get discouraged but but the weighing yourself it sounds like that was pretty like motivating like wow i really need to do this the other thing is that we recommend weighing yourself when you first get up with the same clothes so same time of day same clothing on because that can also affect your weight
117	t: okay okay
305	c: okay i don know if you want to add that or if you just know it it's up to you okay and the first step you can take when you leave here today
106	t: just like to weigh myself right when i'm done eating or something i can weigh myself
304	c: okay so weighing yourself when you're done eating is one idea but of course the you know as we talked about the problem is is your weight can go up like right after you eat
305	c: what else could you maybe do when you leave here ?
106	t: cut down on some fast food restaurants
334	c: okay so if you is there a chance you'd go to a fast food on your way out of ?
109	t: probably
311	c: okay so we we talked about like ordering stuff from the fast food restaurant
302	c: i think there's hand out around here around fast food choices i'll leave all these with you</text>
305	c: <cat>302</cat>
117	t: mm-hmm
313	c: so it sounds like one one step you want to take when you leave here today is when if you do go to a fast food which is something you'd normally do is you're going to make a different choice
305	c: okay so if you want if that's what you want you can write that down it sounds like that that's where you're talking about making the biggest changes
302	c: now some kids find that when they start to make these changes they're hungry because you're you're not eating as much
305	c: what are your thoughts about how you're going to manage ?
302	c: so if you go to the fast food restaurant and you eat a salad and then you know two hours later you're hungrier than you normally are
117	t: i i really don know
302	c: okay you want some ? i mean you said you wanted to eat more fruits and vegetables so one possibility is to have some healthier snacks you know when you're hungry like fruit or some other things might be like pretzels or you know instead of chips or something like that
306	c: what do you think of you know feeling when you feel that hunger going towards the ? would that work for you or kind of ?
112	t: a little
326	c: a little you're not so sure really whether that's going to work because you know when you're hungry you're going to want some of these other foods
302	c: okay well let's think of what else might be another possibility is to have another small meal you know is to just have another like small you know chicken or grilled chicken or you know something that's a little more substantial than just a piece of fruit that really will fill you up
117	t: okay
306	c: would that work better than just the ?
112	t: probably
310	c: probably okay so to think about that then don you know to not be afraid to have a couple of small healthy meals instead of sort of one big whopper and fries you know kind of thing
117	t: okay
306	c: but and to pay attention the other thing to know is that hunger will go away eventually when you start adjusting to a new way of eating so what do you think about some of those ?
112	t: i can work on it
326	c: okay just just know you know that that is a real it sounds like that that's a worry point for you i mean not a worry point but that's a temptation point that when you get hungry that you might do things so you're coming up with another idea so if hunger gets in the way
333	c: you're going to try ?
106	t: having like go eat the fruits and stuff
313	c: eat a fruit or another small healthy meal
117	t: okay
302	c: mm-hmm versus like a bag of chips or a snack some people think like oh okay i already had lunch so i'm just going to have a snack well guess ? sometimes those snacks are worse than laughs another salad or another meal i'm just looking here other ideas are like low fat cheese you know again just even eating a couple of pieces of turkey breast you know like lunch meat you know but healthy lunch meat like turkey breast those kinds of things
301	c: let's talk about i'm going to bring your mom in for a minute you know after i meet with you
112	t: she can help me by not going to buy fast food and stuff like that and bring more fruit and vegetables in the house
323	c: okay so why don you put that ? right here what's something my-you could say mom if that is your mom out there
328	c: okay so just to summarize you you've thought about this already i mean this is none of this is new this is something you've wanted to do for a long time and you've already made some reall;y great changes i mean walking every day is a huge thing and you're committed to it when you set your mind to something you do it
307	c: and now you're setting your mind to a new thing which is you really want to start looking at how you're eating and you're going to specifically eat more fruits and vegetables and when you go to fast food try to order a salad and that's you know that way you're not making like huge changes in every area of your life laughs which is a little overwhelming you're talking about really two specific things so i hope that seems a little more manageable than just sort of like oh all this stuff i mean you know well three things one you're already doing and two you're going to add and if you get in the if hunger gets in the way which you are you know realistic that you might you're going to then instead of going towards junky food you're going to try to just have another small meal or fruits and vegetables and you also came up with a great idea to motivate yourself which is you're going to start weighing yourself every morning so that you can remember okay this is what i'm focusing on because when you remember you do it
117	t: yeah
305	c: it's just more when you don think about it you just sort of go through your life every day so did i get that ?
117	t: yeah
345	c: okay anything else that you wanted to bring ?
117	t: no
301	c: so what are your thoughts about how to share this with your ? i could just bring the paper and show her and you can share it or i can just talk to her and you can keep this on the side or
119	t: no you can show it to her
301	c: okay well what i'll probably do is just talk to her about it and then when we come back together i'll let you you know share with her what you came up with
306	c: is that ?
117	t: okay
