327	c: oh oh my gosh you look so much older my goodness you look very 0:00:13 for a young person
329	c: c laughs i was expecting somebody who looked much younger because you're 14 is that ?
327	c: you look very 0:00:13 for a young person
120	t: oh man is that a bad ?
330	c: no not at all laughs not at all yeah so you're jenai
117	t: yes
301	c: okay i'm lisa i didn speak to you yesterday but i am going to talk with you today so the first thing i wanted to let you know before we get started and before i tell you a little more about what we're going to be doing today is that this is the part of our work together where the cameras are turned on i know that they spoke to you a little bit about that it's nothing to be nervous about laughs and so the other thing to think about too is that for confidentiality meaning the things that we keep private everything that we say in here will be kept private unless you agree to share it with somebody else or unless you let me know that you're in danger of hurting yourself or someone else or that somebody who's elderly or a child is in some kind of trouble
117	t: okay
306	c: okay so does it make you uncomfortable to have the cameras ?
120	t: no i'm always in front of the cameras and stuff at this point yeah
301	c: okay all right so we'll just forget about them then laughs so Ã£Â¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢Â¦ laughs you're here with your auntie or your ?
120	t: my mom
327	c: your mom okay so now we came in today to talk a little bit about weight and some things that we could help you with when you work with me this might be a little bit different from when you work with say a doctor or a nurse or somebody else who might give you directions or tell you what you need to do i'm not going to do that what i'm here to do is to help you think of things to do we've found that it doesn really help people to just tell them what to do it kind of undermines the whole idea of you coming up with a plan that would be beneficial for you so we're here to work together as a team to come up with some ideas and i can help you with that ? okay so how about if we start out by talking about your weight and what you think about it
305	c: </sample>
328	c: okay so you've cut down on fast food you've made some changes to the meats that you eat and the way that they're cooked even though you don want to be a vegetarian you recognize that there are some benefits to eating more vegetables and less of some other foods
106	t: yeah and my sister again she doesn like lots of greens green vegetables but i do i eat carrots i eat canned-i don eat canned fruit because that's not good the syrup it's just gross apples the only thing that i saw her eat like she eat a whole bunch of it in one day is apples and i was upstairs at my grandma's house she took her weight my sister weighs 165 and i was soon as i got on i was 178 so i ran up and down the stairs ran around for an hour came back in drunk a lot of water sat down and watched tv went back outside and boom back again i came back in i was 195 and i seriously did not get why
332	c: you're saying that you went from 178 to 195 in a ?
119	t: yeah all i did i didn eat nothing at all all i did is drink a lot of water go exercise away that's it and i just don get it
302	c: so you bring up an interesting point and that is what we call daily fluctuations or daily changes in a person's weight and i have a little bit of information about that if you'd like me to share it with you so for one it's normal for people's weight to fluctuate day to day so if you were to weigh yourself every single day one thing you might notice is that like you mentioned before you might be 218 one day and then 222 and then 220 and it kind of goes back and forth the important thing is to kind of watch how that changes over time and so in let's say a one month period you were to go from 218 down to say 212 or even 213 that's a pretty healthy amount of weight to lose and it shows a trend over time that it goes down but day to day it might not it might change up and down a little bit day to day the thing that you mentioned about the 178 to 195 i suspect it's probably just where the scale was on the floor or something because that's that doesn that doesn sound like something that would happen for somebody to gain that much weight
119	t: i know yeah because my grandma had the one that you got to step on it's not electric and you hold the back of it you bring it back some so it's there and i ended up weighing 240 i ran upstairs start crying to her she came downstairs she turns the back told me to get on i was i weighed way lesser than that i was like 176 because i lost weight i keep going up and down up and down when i went to the last week it's probably the batteries is dead that's what i was hoping because first i was 160 then i went down to 158 then i was 160 again then i was 154 then i went back up to 175 but i said forget it
302	c: yeah so some of that some of that what you're saying is sounds like normal fluctuation and some of it doesn some of it sounds like the scale or like maybe where it's placed so some of those little scales with the little dial on the top where you have to calibrate it they're not the most accurate so it wouldn be unusual to find some fluctuation that's in addition to your normal fluctuation so if you were like i was mentioning before with healthy weight loss if you were looking at dropping about one or two pounds a week on average that would be a healthy weight loss
119	t: yeah but i wanted to know i seriously wanted to know do a research or something or research it why if you eat vegetables every day if you work out every day you do all you can to lose weight but you still stay the same ? i seriously don get it because even though okay i was bigger than what i am now i was huge and i went over my auntie's house she told me that i lost weight and i said no i didn i still weighed the same she was like you still weigh the same but my stomach got flatter there was no rolls or big ol' jelly things at all i was just exactly flat but when somebody tried to pick me up it's hard to pick me up i don get it like if you skinny you weighed that much it's just so hard
331	c: well what do you know about the change in a person's body shape compared to the change in their ?
119	t: i don know anything they said mostly water
331	c: how do you think you might find that ?
112	t: research
308	c: yeah yeah that's a good idea
331	c: do you know where you could research ?
302	c: okay so there are a few places i can share some information with you if you like
117	t: yes
302	c: so you could check online about changes in body shape another really good place to check is with your doctor is just ask about that and about when your stomach gets flatter but your weight doesn change what does that mean so those are some really good places to start
308	c: as far as how i could help you i'm hearing lots of really interesting things from you i'm hearing lots of information again you know you seem to have an interest in losing weight you also seem to have the ability to learn you know about what you need to do how to keep track of it
328	c: so we've talked a little bit about nutrition and changes you've tried to make in your food we've talked a little bit about keeping track of your weight and how you might do that we've also talked a little bit about research and how you might learn more
306	c: what about any other ?
114	t: no i'm just like a confused little 14 year old just very confusedc
307	c: so let me try to help with that then
309	c: so you're on to some good ideas right
310	c: and it might be more a matter of just finding ways to bring them together so there's another piece i've heard a little bit about yet but we haven talked a lot about and you said you sometimes go and you kind of run around and you do lots of activity so that's the other piece is how much physical activity does it take
305	c: what do you think
106	t: well i actually mainly i usually i don sit down all day 0:13:20 i go out in the kitchen probably cook something cook some mushrooms put them on the pan and fry them stuff like that or walk to the store the store is like six blocks away from my house so i always like to go walking or ride my bike and riding my bike i do frequently skating two times probably a week swimming i would love to do like every single day but ride a bike doesn work swimming doesn work walking doesn work 'cause in sixth through eight no seventh through eighth grade in our gym class we had pe and our park is like two miles two miles long we had to run around there and we had to be there back where our starting point at a specific time and i never in seventh grade i never got to that point but in eighth grade i learned that listening to some music while i work out i lost a lot of weight while i was doing that i don know how i don know but that's how we at the end of the school year had to do five laps around the whole park and i was able to do that five laps around the whole park in 15 minutes and 38 seconds even though i was the fourth of the last i still made it and i got an a in his class and i was happy soon as i got home i said "mom mom mom i got an award a medal" and i got on the scale and it was like so amazing because i was 210 in eighth grade and i went down maybe a lot to 180 and i was happy the next day i woke up right in the morning i didn eat anything else since then and i woke up and i was back to where i was i didn get it
308	c: okay so on one hand you have a lot of experience with what it takes to really work out and get yourself to a point where you can go five times around you even won an award for doing that which is great
323	c: i would be so proud too and i could see in your face how happy that made you
119	t: yeah i cried
307	c: but on the other hand i see that you're still frustrated because what the scale says doesn make sense
331	c: so what do you think about the idea of whether or not the scale is ?
112	t: i just feel like i wish the scale did not exist really because every time i look at the scale and i weighed this much and i'm so happy next day i get disappointed because i weigh more and i do not like feeling that way so i usually want to stay away from scales that's why i went to the doctor i was like no no no i do not want to take my weight i do not want to take the weight but i had to in order for them to help me to figure out what's wrong with me so i got on i was 222 got-that's when i had my asthma attack i had an asthma attack two days ago when i went to the hospital i was 218 i was happy i was like "mom how'd that ? she said she don know "but you been working out lately so" i was like really well why lose that little bit because she said it take a specific time for you to lose all that weight so maybe i ate a lot of room service in the hospital because i spent the night then i got back up to 220 i'm glad that i still lost two pounds now what i expect when i get home i want to take the bus i don want nobody to come pick me up at all i want to take the bus so i can walk to the bust stop get on the bus walk all the way home and once i get home i want to lose at least four pounds
308	c: so you've got it sounds like you've got a lot of motivation to really put some of your ideas into place
106	t: yes and i always do it in a group me and my sister we always we love to dance every time we have like a dance bout or something like that and we do at the end we see who lost the more weight whoever lost the more weight they either get $5 or a person that will be your slave or something like that or have something like that
311	c: yeah something that you
112	t: yeah but my sister that's what motivates her is if there's a prize at the end i was like that's just like so wrong because don you want to change for yourself not for the reward she was like "yeah but it's so good to have a reward but feel good about what you did" i said i understand that but you should just-first you should start thinking about yourself before you think about the reward that's when she started thinking about it and me and her started running around the park a couple of days and she still ended up losing weight and i start gaining weight
311	c: so the overall message that i'm hearing from you is that your motivation really comes from within
304	c: you really have some goal in mind that you want to do for yourself and that the big barrier seems to be knowing how to do it or not knowing how to do it i mean like you've got all the little pieces in place lots of different things that you do that sound like the right things to do but they just don seem to be working
109	t: i'm just like so confused right now i've never been this confused i have been this confused before but not about my weight i don believe i should be weighing 220 right now because i don-they say that i don look 220 look probably 200 maybe not 220 but it's a 20 pound difference but still i don like to be called the biggest girl in school which i'm not and my pe teacher from my high school right now she said black is beautiful fat is beautiful and i said i understand that i love myself but if i love myself that much i'm willing to change myself for myself and she said "i understand that" and she start helping me she gives me daily things to do and when i'm unable to do things like 'cause i'm-it's hard for me to exercise because i have dislocated knees and ever since i was six years old i was jumping off the walls not literally but i was playing with my sister and i jumped out the window and i landed on my legs and my knees went to sideways and ever since then my knees can move all 0:19:39 like this and when i run i always have to wear something that's very very tight around my kneecap or i'm going to end up falling if i fall on it it's going to get stuck i have to come down and pop it back in place it's like so hard ever since that happened exercising for me has been very very hard
312	c: okay so that's something that's a barrier for you too is finding a way to get the exercise in that you know has been successful for you but you have this problem with your knees it makes it difficult
117	t: right
331	c: you mentioned swimming before too is that something that has hurt your knees or ?
112	t: no never had my knees pop under water i'm glad really
331	c: so what are your thoughts on what kinds of exercise really would work for ?
112	t: i really want to-it's the walk that i think is two miles or one mile for the cancer i did it once before and i liked it and i want to be i want to be a swimmer i want to be swimming every single day every single hour i want to rest swim again and right away all day so what i really want to do is do the walk the swimming and the bike
311	c: okay so walking swimming biking sound like exercises that you feel confident that you can do and you want to do them
117	t: yes
331	c: and then as far as nutrition goes are there some things that you think are particularly helpful for ?
103	t: no i really don have a problem with nutrition i think i believe that i be eating the things that are good for me that have nutrition in them but usually i probably don maybe i don read the fat labels that well 2% might be too much for me or something like that i learned that it's an amount that you have to have a day like calories you have to have about 202-like 2200 something about that that's all i know
302	c: so some people to choose you know to focus on a particular thing like they might say you know "i really want to do this biking or swimming walking" that kind of thing and so they might choose to set a goal for themselves and plan out how they might do it other people might choose to work on nutrition and they say "you know it seems like i'm doing the right things but i can also see some areas where i could improve that would help me" so they might decide "you know maybe if i just cut out 500 calories each day if i really look at the foods i'm eating and figure out where i can trim those down a little bit" or they might choose to focus on something like sticking to a lower calorie plan overall smaller portion sizes that sort of thing
106	t: oh right that's what i wanted to talk to you about the portion size now my mom my dad my sister and me we have a big thing about portions so we have these big ol' dishes of plates and a smaller and again smaller smaller smaller every day for dinner we do not use the huge plates we use the portion plates now you can fill that plate up all you want to you won be getting a lot on that plate so they spread the food out like i think two days and throw it out after two days and if we still hungry you have to either eat a piece of fruit or a fruit snack or drink a lot of water when they usually say drink a lot of water before so you end up getting full after that so portion control in my family is brilliant i like portion control
308	c: that's pretty brilliant laughs ?
305	c: and so if you were to pick a goal that i could help you with what do you think that you would like to plan ?
112	t: i'm asking just lose some weight and the way i want to lose weight i want to make it fun i don want to make it boring or this i want someone i want my mom and dad to motivate me to lose weight or me and my sister because even though she might weigh less than me maybe she's still big so there's nothing wrong with being big but we feel that we need to change our self for the better because it's a big thing of high blood pressure in my family and diabetes and one we not want us to have that so 0:24:09
311	c: so your important goals really are health related like you find that in the future you know that there are some risks associated with being bigger and that you would like to avoid those and so you're taking action now to do that
117	t: yes yes
308	c: it's brilliant very ?
305	c: so what particularly do you want to try to change to accomplish your goal what's like a first step that you think you could ?
106	t: maybe just following what i eat writing down what i eat or doing the math on what i eat and finding out the how much calories actually eating a day and doing the math and subtracting adding as i finish eating that thing i subtract it for how much i still need yeah just about the food habits
302	c: it just so happens that i have something in here that might be of help to you if you would like to look at it with me okay so let me get this out i actually do have a lot of resources in here which i will give to you but i think we'll just focus on the thing that you just mentioned right now let's see so what you're talking about you described something called a food log
119	t: right oh yes we did this in eight grade yeah
302	c: okay so i'm going to give you a food log just want to take a moment to go over ?
306	c: now what do you know about food logs and how does this fit with what you ?
119	t: all i know that it's how he asked the questions he wanted us to write down what we eat a day our weight after we eat that then we mark down how much we weigh every time we eat and every time we eat we score it how much did you lose weight did you lose 1% of weight 2% of weight did you gain or lose and stuff like that it's just a lot of questions that was on the paper and he told us to circle one write down what we eat be more specific what did you put in there what's the ingredients and stuff like that then when we get to school we have little laptops and we calculate them look up the words and see what are they are they bad for you or good for you
302	c: so this one is similar in some ways meaning so you can start with the date and time from when you ate you can write down what you ate and drank per day so one thing would go on each line which may be what you did before how much you ate so your portion size where did the food come from meaning was it cooked at home did it come from a restaurant did it come from you know the corner ? you know that kind of thing and here's the calories column so you can keep track of calories this part where it says what did you substitute it for this would be kind of like you mentioned
120	t: with the chicken and the ?
302	c: yeah instead of fried try to have baked you know so did you substitute baked chicken for fried yeah how many calories did you save by doing that that's something you could choose to do if you wanted to keep track of that so if you thought well if i substituted baked for fried how many calories did that save ? and how hungry were you when you sat down to eat because that might make a difference when people are really hungry they might eat more but if you also find that a lot of times you're having a snack when you're not actually hungry that might be a place that could point out for yourself you know this is something i could probably cut out because here is an example of a time when i'm eating and i'm not actually hungry or here's an example of a time when i had a bigger portion but i wasn actually that hungry and by the same token you might notice wow here's a time when i actually did feel hungry but i stuck to a smaller portion and i wasn hungry afterwards so you can use that as a learning tool and how did you feel so was your mood associated with eating more or less and how helpful is that for you so there's some benefits to using a food log like this like you said so if you would like to use that one this one's available for you and i'll give that to you in your folder
117	t: okay
311	c: okay so it sounds like you're pretty set on using a food log might be the most beneficial first step you could take some people when they identify what would be a great first step for them they come up with a ?
302	c: some people when they identify what would be a great first step for them they come up with a plan some people just think about it and keep it in their heads and other ones want to write it down so that they can hang it on the fridge or some place where they can see it and help stick to it
305	c: what do you think you might like to ?
112	t: i'm 0:28:55 well i really want to talk to my mom about it i want to see what her plans are for me will she like will she motivate me or will she motivate me in what is she hopping for from me and stuff like that but the food log i can hang it up every day look what i ate this day and see if i can do better the next day
311	c: well so you mentioned something that is important to you is having the food log hanging up where you can track of it use it as a tool
301	c: after i talk to you and after you and i have discussed what you might do and how you plan to do it i'm also going to talk with your mom and come up with exactly what you said how can she support you
306	c: and then i'll see the two of you together and we can talk about the plans that each of you have and how they might work together how does that ?
117	t: that's good
305	c: okay so if you and i were to come up with a specific plan for how you want to use your food log you just really just said a lot of it did you want to just talk through the rest of it or did you want to write it down so that you have it ?
112	t: i can do both actually but i can write
329	c: okay let me get you-i have a food plan or i'm sorry a goal printed out
308	c: i will even help you write it because you have so many good ideas
302	c: so in this plan this is just a way to help keep your plan organized and saved you could write down what your plan to do is so you mentioned keeping a food log why you want to do that and then in this section what you and i will talk through and i'll help you with this is we can figure out things that might get in the way of you being able to keep using this and what you might do if those things happen and then the first step that you're going to take in order to reach your goal and something your mom could do to help you reach your goal
301	c: and then after we finish this you and i will be done for a short time i'll talk with your mom and then i'll talk with both of you together
305	c: c what do you want to write down for what your plan ?
106	t: my plan is to use the food log
301	c: okay well let's write that right there
308	c: you've got so many good ideas
344	c: yeah now if you are trying to use your food log each day what are some of the things that you think could possibly get in your ?
120	t: writing down what i ?
344	c: yeah what might stop you from doing that every day like you ?
120	t: maybe i 0:32:48
301	c: okay so that could be something that you might write down ?
344	c: can you think of anything else that might get in your ?
109	t: maybe homework usually if i'm on the phone i usually don do it so
308	c: it sounds like you've been really thoughtful about these kinds of things before yeah
117	t: i think that's about it
333	c: okay so for each of those and maybe this would apply to more than one at a time but if one of those was to happen what do you think you might do to try to fix it or overcome ?
106	t: for mom wanting me to do a favor i'll try to do it quick fast and hurry don waste the time homework i would do a little homework fill it out do a little homework fill it out cell phone cut it off or put it on airplane mode or tell people that i'm busy instead of giving in talking to them
313	c: oh i got you so if it rings while you were filling out your food log one thing you mentioned you could do is either shut it off ahead of time so it doesn disturb you
120	t: right should i write that ? okay
308	c: yeah those are some really fantastic ideas sounds like that would be quite helpful to you
305	c: so let's see so the first step that you can take so if your goal is to use your food log each day what's the very first thing you could do to make that ?
106	t: make sure i have it with me when i'm at the youth center
120	t: like what else-oh i got it
308	c: so then what do you think as you look over your plan which is a very nice ?
331	c: what do you think is something your mom could do to really help support you and make sure that you can be ?
112	t: 0:36:50 over ? i think she could try try to do it with me do it make it a family activity
309	c: nice ?
311	c: so you're feeling like if your mom was to support you by doing it like her own food ?
117	t: mm-hmm make it Ã£Â¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢Â¦
301	c: okay so at this point now that you've completed a plan which is something that you'll be able to take home with you i'm going to talk to your mom for a few minutes
306	c: how would you like to share your ?
301	c: we can do a couple different things i can either share with her you could share it with her when the two of you come together to meet with me
112	t: maybe she can if you show it to her she have something to think about when i explain it to her
311	c: okay so you want to do both you would like her to have an opportunity to see it so that she can develop her own plan too based on that and then you also want to talk about it when you come together
117	t: yes
301	c: would it be okay if when the two of you come together could i say "jenai would you please share with your mom what you'd really like to do" and i'll take the plan out and you can use it as
117	t: of course
308	c: great sounds good so you've really gotten a lot accomplished today
120	t: i ?
313	c: yeah yeah you've got a whole written plan now you
112	t: oh i'm proud of myself 0:38:46 laughs
309	c: yeah you should ?
301	c: so why don i walk you out into the waiting room and then i'm going to just put this in my folder so that i have it for your mom to see i'll meet with her a little bit and then i'll bring you guys back together ?
