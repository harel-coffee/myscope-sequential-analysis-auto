345	c: okay what do you go by for your first ?
117	t: elise
327	c: elise ?
309	c: i like that that's pretty
343	c: okay so why don you tell me a little bit about sort of what's going on with you with your weight how you're feeling about it why you came here today
106	t: well they have-we were in the catch program before and the catch program that we were in it helped us we started eating different we lost a lot of weight from that and i guess they had direct us from that so i guess they wanted us to try something else and so we came in we have no problem with changing diets or anything so we're just willing to try anything
313	c: okay so you've been really working on this for a long time in terms of your health and you don have any issues concerns about changing your diet
106	t: mm-mm any changes i'm willing to make i'm not going to get mad about changes or anything
313	c: okay okay so you're willing to do things and you're not getting angry about stuff that you need to do
333	c: so tell me what kinds of changes you've made so far
106	t: well i started eating more fruits and more vegetables so it's kind of still going the same page i haven stopped eating more vegetables but we have stopped eating a lot of fast food we cook more meals at home we bake more food than anything now
313	c: so you're eating more fruits and vegetables cut back on fast food and you're baking foods more versus using oils and things like that
331	c: okay and have you seen any outcomes from these ?
106	t: actually i have my mom we was in the catch program my mom last over 15 pounds i lost over 20 so we actually did really good in that
308	c: uh-huh sounds like that really good i mean that's a big chunk of weight mm-hmm
106	t: yeah she got back to her-she got closer back to the ones and i got out of the twos completely and i'm still out of the twos so i'm going to keep it that way if i can get back to my normal size which was 175 but i'm getting close i'm 189 so
313	c: okay so you have a goal already it sounds like for 175 and you've already lost a fair amount so you're close to that and you'd like to keep going to get to that goal
106	t: yeah i do a lot of walking i have a dog and i walk to school every day so that helps
313	c: okay so you walk to school every day and you have a dog that likes to get walked too i'm hearing
117	t: mm-hmm
333	c: okay and now that school's out what are you doing for ?
106	t: well i still go to school i have summer school
313	c: oh you're in summer school okay
106	t: so i'm still walking from school and to school every day
311	c: mm-hmm okay so it sounds like really you're pretty motivated to do this
331	c: what are the reasons that you want to get down to ?
112	t: well because i know it's a lot of people that's overweight in my family and for them being overweight it caused them to be diabetics i have low sugar and high sugar and all that other stuff so i decided i didn want to go through all the health problems although diabetes and sugar problems run in the family so it wouldn have to do with you gaining weight or losing weight or anything 'cause it just runs in the family but i'd rather be on the safe side by me taking precautions
311	c: right so you know that diabetes runs in the family and there's a certain part of it that's genetic but you also know that you might be able to avoid some of the things by taking precautions and keeping your weight down and it sounds like your health is what's motivating you right now you want to be healthy and strong
117	t: yeah
331	c: other reasons why you might want to be down to a lower ?
112	t: well i know i was in a nursing program and that kind of helped me lose a lot of weight too because we doing a lot of running around doing a lot of things and a nurse is what i wanted to be so i already knew that my senior year which is going to be coming up this year we go into hospitals and actually work on real patients so we are only running around hospitals and with that you lose a lot of weight from that 'cause you gotta go up and down stairs and take
311	c: so you need to keep your energy up to do these clinicals and if you were at a lower weight you might be able to run around you know it would be easier for you to run around and you have a professional goal which is important to you i'm hearing which is the nursing
120	t: and if that doesn go well i will be a police officer so it still
327	c: you have a backup plan
117	t: yeah
311	c: and both of them require you to be kind of physically fit both of these jobs okay well it sounds like you're a young woman with a lot of ideas you know and plans for yourself and i'm hearing a real sort of like this is what i'm going to do and this is my backup plan i'm going to do it yeah
120	t: i had to plan everything out already especially with this being my last year in school
328	c: so you're thinking ahead yeah
305	c: so you know i'm hearing that you already made a fair amount of changes with fruits and vegetables and being active and you want to keep this going so where are you at right now in terms of how to kick it up a notch maybe or something a new thing you might want to add either with diet or with nutrition or exercise i don know if you have ideas if you want to look at some ideas
112	t: well i'm always into new ideas
302	c: okay well we can kind of go through some of these-i'm going to leave these with you some of these are just resources and you know like ideas that are in the community so i'll leave that with you and you know we can just kind of take a bird's eye view and you can pick which one you might want to talk about
112	t: this one i learned how to read the charts on the bottles
311	c: on the bottles
106	t: and stuff so i actually pay attention to them more than anything i look at something while i'm eating oh this got such and such calories
311	c: okay so you already have learned about food labels and you know how to-and that's something you got out of the program it sounds like
112	t: yeah so i was doing a lot of that
302	c: so okay so let's see this talks about kind of increasing your activity a little bit more like three days a week for 60 minutes of high intensity or four days a week for sort of lower intensity and strength so that's one thing you could do is increase exercise
106	t: well the exercise that i do is like besides the walking my dog and walking to school my brother's very playful so we do a lot of running around the house playing and wrestling and a lot of other things
313	c: so you stay just active kind of on a day to day basis
112	t: with him living there yes
345	c: uh-huh how old's your ?
120	t: my brother is 22
327	c: okay and he's physical guy
106	t: yeah he likes-like he's very playful so with him being there i have no choice but to run around and play and then we go outside we play we run in the backyard and play with the dog or we might play a little basketball or we might just do a little anything
310	c: so for you it's not so much like planned activity but maybe staying away from tv and like things that make you sit around and just being more active in general
112	t: you know what i don really watch tv like that any more it's boring and i like to do activities now i like to
308	c: you've really changed a lot
112	t: i like to stay moving because i don like being clamped up in a house anymore so i always want to go somewhere
308	c: right right okay so this might not be really right now what you need to focus on because you feel like you're doing pretty good with being physical and staying away
302	c: so in terms of food we've got staying away from sugary drinks healthier choices around the fast food in restaurants we can talk about looking at portion sizes another thing people do is writing down foods
106	t: i did i had started it when i was in catch program i was also in weight watchers so weight watchers you have to write down what have you ate how much have you ate and i would always take a big portion but now i won and if i try to my mom get on my head about it so i learned how to take smaller portions get smaller plates and i just eat what i have and wait for everybody else to eat and if i still want to eat i go eat food afterward
313	c: so you keep a small portion of-like your first pass is a small portion and then if you're still hungry then you try to go back for fruits and vegetables
117	t: yes
328	c: okay so you know i guess maybe you can tell me a little more about in the catch program you lost 20 pounds and since-and you have a goal of getting down to 175
333	c: so since catch have you lost weight stayed the same or gained ?
106	t: i actually lost more weight because with the catch program i was like 215 and i and before i got out of the catch program i know i was 200 and when i got out i started losing more and more weight which led me to 189 and my weight goes up and down really quick and i can really burn off weight really quick and so losing weight wouldn be a problem with me because losing it is easy keeping it off is something that i have to wok on which is like not eating as much just for me i like fruits a lot so i eat more fruits and i eat anything i eat fruits all day
308	c: okay okay so it sounds like maybe you really don need to do any new things because it sounds like most of the stuff you're already doing you mentioned recording food and you know that's often a good way to lose weight which you've talked about
333	c: how are you doing with recording what your intake right ?
106	t: well i don record but i know what i've ate and i know how much i've ate of it
313	c: you can kind of do it in your head
106	t: yeah do it in my head and i can like okay well i don need this i ate that earlier so
305	c: mm-hmm so if you were thinking about then what you'd like to do for a goal as you leave here today you mentioned you know a goal of getting down to 175 would you say that's pretty much still your ?
112	t: it is
301	c: okay so we have a paper here which you don have to do some people like to do it it's called a change plan we can either just talk about it or you can write it down
305	c: what would you ?
119	t: oh she wrote down something like this with me too she wrote all the steps down of what i was going to do
330	c: mm-hmm yeah
112	t: we can write it down
305	c: okay so i'll leave it with you so your plan is to lose weight down to 175 okay so i'll let you write unless you prefer me to ? laughs it's ? okay my plan is to-just tell me how you want to say it because this is your plan
106	t: to get back down to the normal size
313	c: get back down to my normal size what you think is normal for you and you said that is 175
117	t: mm-hmm
305	c: can i write-would you like me to write ?
117	t: yeah
331	c: okay and why you want to do this
112	t: because it was something that i had planned on doing just losing weight makes me feel better
328	c: something i had planned on you're the kind of person that makes a plan and tries to stick with it and that's a big motivator for you and it makes you feel better and you mentioned also the diabetes precautions feel better less chance of diabetes or maybe you'll get it when you're much older instead of younger or something like that
117	t: yeah
344	c: okay and what kinds of things might get in the way of getting back down to that size and keeping it
305	c: because you mentioned that that's really important to you
109	t: like when we have family events where it's a lot of food around
307	c: okay so family events is a real tough one i can understand that
344	c: in the summer are there more of those less of those or about the ?
109	t: it's a lot of those
326	c: lot of those in the summer family events
333	c: and what kinds of things can you try to overcome you know that ?
106	t: well i stay when that happens i try to stay outside
313	c: to like stay away from the food
333	c: 'cause it's real easy when it's like right in front of you try to stay away from the food mm-hmm any other ?
106	t: eat the fruits that's out
308	c: yep it sounds i mean so many kids don eat fruits and vegetables it sounds like that's a real strength for you
313	c: eat the fruits okay
344	c: what else might get in the way that you find is a real challenge in terms of dropping the ?
109	t: it's just family events otherwise i
306	c: that's it everything else is okay with ?
117	t: yeah
333	c: what about when summer school's ?
120	t: well i go straight home when summer school's out so that's not like a challenge
329	c: i mean the walking thing
313	c: like you mentioned that that's a big part of your walking plan is to school and back
117	t: yeah
344	c: so if summer school's out is that a barrier in terms of the ?
106	t: no because i still have a dog so i'm still going to be walking
301	c: okay so i don need to put that one down
308	c: okay so what's the-you know first step doesn really apply you've made the first steps
305	c: so what's-after you leave here today what new thing would you like to do or add or focus on
308	c: in terms of continuing the great work you've already ?
106	t: just continue to go the way i'm going
313	c: just continue okay
331	c: and what can your mom do to help ?
112	t: she's basically doing the same thing she's not walking as much as i'm doing but she will walk when she goes shopping and that's a lot of walking because we go from store to store to store so
331	c: so she could walk with ?
117	t: mm-hmm
311	c: is something she can do
331	c: anything else that would help ? does she bring fatty foods around the house that are hard for you to avoid or does she keep it pretty ?
112	t: well she really she eats a lot of fruits too dan she eat more vegetables than i eat so she's just it's just the walking
328	c: okay so walking with you
305	c: and you mentioned she sometimes gets on you is that a good thing or a not so good ?
112	t: it's good because if she wasn then i just be
311	c: so you want her to keep reminding you okay so she can keep reminding you yeah
117	t: mm-hmm
306	c: okay okay do you think we covered most of ?
117	t: yeah
328	c: okay so just to summarize
308	c: then you have made some wonderful changes and you know you are beyond just the weight you're a person who makes a plan for yourself and sticks with it and finds a backup plan if it doesn work
328	c: nursing and then police work family events if it doesn work to stay away from food eat the fruits you know backup plans
308	c: you've made great changes and you feel better i can tell you're feeling pretty good about yourself and you want to just continue that process
328	c: and your mom can help by walking with you and to keep doing what she's doing
117	t: yeah
306	c: is there anything else that i didn ?
117	t: mm-mm
301	c: okay the next thing is i'm going to meet with your mom and i can either share this with her directly or i could just talk to her about it what would you ?
119	t: share it
301	c: okay so i'll just leave it out and then she'll kind of also talk about what she's going to want to do to help you and keep going and then we'll get back together all ?
