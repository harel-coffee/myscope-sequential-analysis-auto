301	c: before we get started i just wanted to let you know a few things one that this is the part of your session with me where the cameras are on
345	c: it's your mom that you're with ?
117	t: mm-hmm
301	c: okay then i'll meet with her for about 20 minutes and then i'll bring the two of you together
117	t: okay
305	c: ? and what we're here to do today is just help you out to think of some ideas that you might want to work on i'm not here to tell you what to do so this is kind of your show and i'm here to help you come up with some ideas that might feel a little bit different from how you've usually talked to people about making some changes for weight loss is ?
117	t: yeah
345	c: yeah laughs what have you usually had people tell ?
119	t: like to try don eat this or eat that just don do it
327	c: so they've given you a lot of directions and dos and dons
117	t: yeah
305	c: yeah well i'm not going to do that laughs
117	t: okay
345	c: okay so in any case do you have any questions before we get ?
117	t: no
301	c: okay alrighty well good so i guess you know one place to start is just to kind of find out where you're at and what do you think about your weight right now
112	t: i don really know i mean i want to get down 1:42
331	c: okay so well what's make you say ?
112	t: what that i want to get ? i don know 'cause i'm 14 and i weigh more than 204 pounds
331	c: okay so is it that you feel like that's too high a number or has somebody given you some ?
112	t: to me that's too high of a number for a 14-year-old
331	c: okay alright so what have you heard so far if you don mind me asking from doctors or nurses or maybe other ?
119	t: from doctors like they say that that's for like the height i am and like the age i am i should really be down because i'm obese for my age
331	c: okay and what do you think of ?
109	t: nothing i think 2:32 i mean when i'm ready i will be i'm going to be down but right now
305	c: okay well so one thing that i don want to do is i don want to make the mistake of assuming that just because you came here that you're ready 'cause you might not be so what's you're goal for ? what are you hoping to accomplish by coming ?
112	t: i just hope that i can lose you know some pounds or try
311	c: okay so you're looking for some ideas on what to ?
117	t: yeah
331	c: okay do you have some things that you've tried already or maybe you have some knowledge on what people generally ?
106	t: well me and my sister like we do work out; we like do sit-ups until we can
313	c: mm-hmm okay so you do sit-ups
331	c: and what was the other thing you ?
106	t: do like sit-ups like we try a few 3:25
313	c: oh okay kind of like flutter kicks or that kind of thing okay alright so you have a little bit of a workout that you do with your sister
333	c: and are there any other things that you've ?
106	t: maybe like we get up early in the morning and jog
313	c: okay so you've got a couple things that you do that might be different from what other people do
302	c: i mean some people just kind of assume that they can just you know maybe do a little bit more than they usually do but they don have a real plan for it
308	c: it sounds like you've actually tried to do an exercise plan or a workout plan because you're describing things that are not just being more active but they're actual workouts laughs
333	c: how often do you work ?
106	t: every day
333	c: okay for how ?
117	t: i don know laughs
313	c: do you so you work out every day but you're not sure how long
331	c: do you have some other ideas on things that people might do if they wanted to change their ?
109	t: maybe like 4:38 like 'cause i don want to work out sometimes so my sister encourages me i don really 4:48
328	c: okay alright so one thing i hear you saying is that you have some ideas you have some things that you've done i mean you have a desire to work out to change your weight but sometimes it comes right down to it's time to work out and you just don feel like it
331	c: how successful has it been so far do you ?
119	t: i used to be 209 5:20
331	c: okay tell me 5:25 you used to be 209 and you're
119	t: one 204
309	c: 204 okay i was going to say wow that's a big laughs that's a big difference so you've lost five pounds
331	c: in the past how ?
119	t: like two weeks
328	c: okay alright so you've got some activity routines that you do and some people that help you by trying to motivate you
302	c: when people think about you know the things that they do for weight loss and what they need to do they often come up with a couple different things
313	c: you've already mentioned physical activities so people become more active and it sounds like that's something that's already in place for you
302	c: and people also make another change they usually change what they eat or how much they eat
305	c: is that something that you've thought ?
106	t: i don try to change what i eat but i do cut down on my limits
343	c: okay can you tell me a little bit about ?
106	t: like i don be 6:28 like if i had like a plate or something like 6:32 i'll finish and i'll probably go back and get some more like i don know why i just wanted to eat like i've cut down on that and i've cut down on like all how much i 6:42 put on my plate that's what i do
313	c: okay so you're cutting down on portions
331	c: and if you were to think about how successful you've been with that cutting down on your portions as well as your physical activity that you've been doing which of those would you say is most ?
112	t: my portions
311	c: your portions okay
305	c: and so if i was to help you really focus in on something today that you could plan for that you think would be the most help to you in the future what would you want to work ?
112	t: i guess trying to exercise a little bit more
302	c: okay alright so what if we talk about things that you could do and i have some information in here that i can show you if you're interested
306	c: so do you know what that means when i say high ?
302	c: so people who think about low medium and high intensity activity as being like you know the song people sing happy birthday when somebody has a birthday if you were singing that song and you were able to sing it pretty comfortably you'd be doing like mild intensity activity and if you were able to sing it but you have to take extra breaths so it wouldn be really smooth that would be like moderate or medium intensity activity and if you could only say it and you'd probably have to take some breaths there too then that's more like high intensity activity ? so that's something that you might give it a try just to kind of see where you're at and if you need to improve the intensity of your activity ? so in the 60-minute period you might think about 20 minutes of stretching on either end 20 minutes of strength training and aerobic activity and this is where the weight loss will really come into play is with the aerobic activity that you do but these other things help too
117	t: okay
310	c: ? and then the other option i was going to show you is this is a physical activity log where you could just keep track of what you do and that way you'd know whether it needs to increase or decrease over time
117	t: mm-hmm
306	c: does that make ?
117	t: yeah
329	c: yeah so here's a space for each day of the week and you could write down what and this says lifestyle activity because we recognize that not everybody has a workout that they do but people are sometimes active in other ways too so you'd write down what you did how long you did it for how vigorous it was so you'd say easy medium if it's vigorous yeah it does say that there but i'm having a hard time reading them upside down
306	c: and are you familiar with calorie burning at ?
117	t: mm-hmm
310	c: okay so if you have a sense of how many calories you burned then you could write that down too which might help you keep track
117	t: okay
302	c: then this final column says how long would i watch ? but it might not be just tv it could be anything that involves like sitting or not being very active so reading which is healthy in some ways 'cause it works out your mind but not so much your body same with tv and video games so kind of like computer time
310	c: so if you were to circle for yourself 30 minutes for each tv you could start to get a sense of whether this needs to decrease whether this time spent being active needs to increase
305	c: ? so of these two things to focus on just kind of generally making improvements or really keeping close track of what you're doing are either of these ideas ones that you might want to ?
117	t: mm-hmm
112	t: the 11:04 one
305	c: okay okay and you can try both i'm not going to stop you laughs i mean ultimately like i said it's your show
301	c: so but since you kind of have a preference for this one why if we focus on this one today and i'm going to give you these other things to take home with you so you can look at them ? and today with our ideas it's just kind of giving you some place to start so that you have kind of a plan in place that you can begin with and build up
311	c: so it seems like this is pretty important to you
331	c: why is it so ?
112	t: i don know i just think i also think like at my age i shouldn be this size i mean 'cause when i was younger i used to be really really skinny and i don know what happened
307	c: sometimes it's hard to explain those things
302	c: our bodies start to change and we don really get a good sense of where that comes from because you might not be doing things a whole lot differently or maybe you are but don realize it
117	t: yeah
307	c: so you're confused by something has changed laughs
311	c: yeah okay so it's important to you because you would like to get your weight under control for yourself it sounds like
302	c: so that can be a pretty strong motivator
112	t: i don care what other people think i care what i think
308	c: mm-hmm alright well that's you know if you're going to be motivated by something your own thoughts are a pretty strong one and you can really you know do a lot with that
333	c: what do you think you might do to keep yourself going on days when you don feel like ? like doing your workout
106	t: i think i will try to like really hard to motivate myself so i can work out 'cause even if my sister's not there i can do it by myself like starting with walk around if she's not there or my little sisters do workouts
328	c: okay alrighty well you know you've mentioned a couple things that will probably continue to be helpful to you you know and one is that you've chosen to have a formal way of keeping track of things you've also mentioned that it's important to you because you really care what you think about yourself and how you feel and you've also mentioned that you've had the support of your
345	c: how many ?
120	t: two
328	c: two sisters and you know it seems like those people are there for you and they don just tell you what to do they actually do it with you
313	c: and you know i saw when you were talking about that you were kind of smiling
308	c: which makes me think that they're doing a great job you know there's something that they're doing that you really respond to
117	t: okay
333	c: so if you think about you know this plan that you're starting to let take shape here you know how committed do you feel to actually starting it going home tonight and saying "let's get the first step done"
112	t: i feel pretty good
345	c: ?
106	t: i'm finally doing it
333	c: well if i was to ask you to rate it say on a scale of one to ten with one being "you know i don know what this lady is talking about i'm leaving here laughs not doing anything" and ten being "yeah you know ? i can wait to get home and start this i'm going to start recording my things on my sheet the minute i get home" where would you ?
106	t: i think i would be eight
308	c: wow an ! that's like almost at a ten laughs
112	t: yeah 'cause i am motivated to go home and try to lose weight and try to record the stuff
331	c: mm-hmm so what's the difference for you between like a seven and an ? why was it eight and not ?
119	t: i don know i don know 'cause to me they're both high and they both 15:12 but 15:19
331	c: what do you think it would take to push it to a ?
117	t: i don know i can really answer that
310	c: mm-hmm that's okay so maybe it has to come out of more maybe more of our conversation or some things that happen over the next couple days so okay alrighty
345	c: well do you before we move on do you have any questions for ?
117	t: no
302	c: okay alright so some people decide that they would like to just talk about their plan and other people decide "you know ? it would really help me if i had a written plan that i can remember that i can hang up in my house somewhere and keep track of"
305	c: what would work best for ?
112	t: i think 16:06 hang it up somewhere so i can always remember
301	c: okay alright well i have a plan in here if you would like to use it okay
329	c: we have these nice little plans 16:16 that are i think pretty handy
301	c: so we've already talked about a lot of this 16:25 this way you've already said that your plan is to use that long sheet and you've already said why it's important to you to do that we have a couple of other things that we could get down on paper here too if you think about you know what might stop ? and the reason that i say that is that no matter how great of a plan somebody has or no matter how motivated they are like you said you're at an eight which is pretty high you know as far as your commitment but even though you're at an eight there might still be some stumbling blocks that could get in the way if you're not prepared so maybe we could prepare ahead of time by saying "well here are the things that could stop me but this is what i'm going to do about them if they happen" we could say what the step you'll take is once you leave here today to make your plan start working and then who you want to support you and what they could do
117	t: okay
305	c: so would it be okay if i give you the pen to write some of these things ?
117	t: mm-hmm
309	c: great
301	c: okay so you might start right here with what your plan is
305	c: would you like some help or some ? okay so let's see may i look at what you already ?
117	t: mm-hmm
301	c: okay so let's see you said your plan is "to get down and start doing more things to help me and i want to do those because i want to lose it" so let's see it might help if we say "if this gets in the way"
333	c: when you think about what it means like when you think in your head to get down and start doing more things to help me what specifically comes to ? like what are you what do you picture yourself ?
103	t: i'll be like just eating
328	c: okay okay so a minute ago we were talking about using little 19:51 form to keep track of your physical activity
333	c: but you're kind of leading more toward making some changes with your eating ?
117	t: mm-hmm
309	c: okay so and that's fine
305	c: i mean like i said laughs this is your these are your ideas
333	c: so if you think about making changes with what you're eating or how you eat what specifically would you like to start with doing
112	t: i think fast food
330	c: okay
103	t: like fast food and junk food 'cause i know i would eat fast food like that and i'll eat like junk food
311	c: okay so you want to cut down on fast food and junk food
306	c: particularly junk food ?
333	c: so when you say cut down what do you see yourself doing ?
106	t: stop try to stop going to the store and buying chips and every single candy 20:35
309	c: okay so there that's pretty specific
301	c: so you might say "i'm going to be doing more things to help me such as not going to the store to buy chips and candy ? yeah just tuck it under
305	c: and i think you know you tell me what you think
309	c: but it seems like this fits pretty well
306	c: i mean you could still say that you want to stop going to the store and buy junk food because you want to lose weight ?
117	t: mm-hmm
301	c: okay so now that we know that we have a very detailed plan about what specific change you want to make right now now you can think more carefully about something that could get in your way
344	c: so what might stop you from holding back when you want to go to the ?
112	t: i think my sisters laughs my sister 22:02 "don eat this" or me i think i'm going to stop the soda too 'cause i don really need that 22:13
311	c: okay so two things that you mention is that one your sisters might be able to help you by saying "you don really need to do that" and you might be able to say that to yourself too so those are things that could help you
344	c: but what might get in your ? like if you wanted to stop yourself from going to the store what might happen that would cause you to go ?
109	t: i think just i just want it 'cause it's-how can-i just want it craving right now just wanna go to get it
309	c: i think you just said a key word
345	c: did you pick up on it when you said ?
117	t: yeah
332	c: what was ?
119	t: craving
302	c: yeah so and cravings can be very difficult to deal with you know lots of people struggle with cravings and if you're interested we can talk a little bit about cravings okay so you know if you think about when you have a craving it's usually for a specific food
103	t: i get 23:21 like candy
302	c: so something sweet okay the good news about cravings is they really are just cravings it's not something your body has to have and they do go away like if you ever find yourself in a position where you really wanted a candy bar like really bad but you weren in a position to get one 'cause either you didn have the money to get one on you or like it was the beginning of the day at school and you knew it was going to be like six hours before you could go so you'd just have to wait right
117	t: yeah
331	c: what did you do to make that craving go ?
119	t: 23:58 like when i was at school so i just thought like i just stopped thinking about it doing my work started listening
331	c: so how did you stop thinking about ?
120	t: teacher asked me a question laughs i was in math and i didn get it so i just i told him i didn get it i thought "alright" i actually listened and stopped thinking about it
331	c: so the question it seems was something that distracted you from the ?
117	t: mm-hmm
311	c: okay so now we have another key word and that's a distraction
310	c: so if maybe we can think about it like this like if you mentioned that a craving could get in your way so we might say if a craving gets in the way then i could try something that would be distracting you might have to i don know what would be distracting for you but so you might have to think of some ideas
120	t: okay i really don know how to spell craving
330	c: oh c-r-a-v-i-n-g
117	t: thank you
333	c: so what did you come up with for your ?
106	t: i just said "talking to friends and family" or "26:53 or just thinking like do i really need ?
309	c: great
333	c: and how comfortable do you feel like those things will really do the trick for ?
112	t: i feel pretty comfortable 'cause i think like my friends are very supportive and i know they'll support me and do other things
331	c: do you feel comfortable in talking to your friends about this and letting them know "this is something i'm working on i could really use your help 'cause sometimes i have cravings and it's hard for me"
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: okay so a lot of people do find that social support like friends and family is really helpful to them so
344	c: okay do you feel like there is anything else that might make it hard for you not to go to the store and get junk ?
112	t: definitely my sister
332	c: laughs okay so how would you describe ? like how would your sister get in the ?
112	t: probably just keep telling me or get in front of me get in front of the door and tell me i really don need this
301	c: okay okay so that actually probably will fit better down here
329	c: so i think this is worded little bit confusingly
344	c: like so when i say something that could get in the way what i really mean is what could make it hard for you to stop yourself from going to the ? like what would make it so that you go to the store instead of holding ?
117	t: i don know
308	c: okay well you came up with a really big one and that is your craving might make it hard for you to say "i'm not going to go to the store right now"
310	c: and you might think of some other things or you might notice some other things as you're using your plan and then i mean it's your plan you can write them down another time too so
305	c: the next step for us to think about is the first step for you to take in order to make this goal happen for you and right now you have a specific goal that's just one part of your big plan what's the first step you can do to stop yourself from going to the store for junk ?
106	t: for me it would be like saving my money like putting it somewhere so like i could just forget about it till i really really need it
308	c: that's a really great point
331	c: yeah and so if you had something a place where you could put your money and not get it then that would make it so much easier for you wouldn ? do you have something like ?
112	t: yeah i do
331	c: what do you ?
112	t: it's actually like an old pencil sharpener like i just put it like in the bottom of the thing and like i put it up until like i really need the money
311	c: okay so if the first step that you could take would be to start putting your money in your old pencil sharpener
331	c: where would you is there someplace that you'd need to put it in order for you to be able to get to it easily and put your money in ?
112	t: 29:42 the top of my closet
310	c: okay so maybe that's the first step for you to take is to put it up on the top of your closet and start using it okay
308	c: boy you're just making things happen left and right laughs
301	c: so the last thing on your plan is people who can help you to reach your goal and you've mentioned several different people as we've been talking
331	c: so if you were to start out by asking particular people for their support in some way who would you ?
106	t: i'd ask my family first
331	c: okay do you have anybody in particular in your family that you think you could go to ?
112	t: 30:57 my sisters
301	c: okay alright so then you could put sisters right there so it would read "something my sisters could do to help me reach my goal"
331	c: what is it particularly that you think they could ?
112	t: i do think they could stop me from going to the store and like encourage me to work out like they can do what they can to try to help me try to help me stop eating a lot of food and going to the store or not
345	c: mm-hmm and how would they do ?
112	t: they talk to me like they talk to me like i could understand like "jacole you really don need these like you are trying to lose weight you're trying to get down so why don you to go and do ? that's just going to get your weight back up"
328	c: okay so a couple things that i really hear you saying are important to you to hear from your sisters are for them to say things to you that would motivate you one not to go to the store and two would motivate you to work out
306	c: ?
331	c: so do you feel like you have the words that you want to say that would remind you if you were to write that ?
120	t: yeah what they say to ?
331	c: yeah like what particularly would you ask them to say to ? so what did you come up ?
112	t: 33:47 said i would like them to keep saying to me that i'm doing good and like i want the thing but i don have to have it and like i brought myself so far in my life make myself go back and i would just i would like them to keep saying that to me
328	c: okay so you have some particular things that would be helpful to you to hear that are very motivating for you and one thing that i want to really highlight that i heard you say is that kind of like the idea just because you want something doesn mean you have to have it you've come so far don go back now that kind of thing so these are kind of inspirational and motivational things that you want to hear from them
117	t: yeah
331	c: okay so how do you feel about your ? is this
112	t: i feel good
328	c: okay great this is a start you know overall you had several things that you mentioned we talked about some physical activity or workouts that you are interested in doing and i showed you a couple of forms that you can use and then you were talking some about changing eating habits and you became very detailed it said you know particularly "let's go into the store and buy junk food" and that's where we've started so you have a plan for that now
305	c: and like i said earlier this is one step among many that you may take in the future but this kind of helps you i think to organize some thoughts around how you might accomplish your goal and nobody says that as you accomplish each goal you develop some new ones
306	c: do you have any questions about the things that we've talked about or how to do ?
117	t: no
330	c: no laughs okay
120	t: i'm not really a question asking person
308	c: okay well you came up with some very good ideas and it sounds like they're definitely ideas that are meaningful to you
302	c: which is helpful because that's how people accomplish their goals is they come up with ideas that really mean something to them and then they're more likely to follow through on them so
301	c: at this point what i'll do is in a moment i'll take you out into the other room and i think you have a couple things to do with the research assistants who worked with you earlier i'll talk with your mom for a few minutes and then we'll all come together
305	c: if this plan right here if we were think about how your mom could support you also which is something i'd like to talk to her about would it be helpful for you to share your plan when we all come together or would you like me to talk with your mom about it ?
119	t: you can talk to her
309	c: okay alright sometimes that is helpful
329	c: i'm glad that you said that
305	c: would it be okay if i show her your plan or do you want to me to just talk about it with ?
119	t: you can show her
309	c: okay alright that sounds good
301	c: so what i'll do is i'll walk you out in the other room and i'll see you again in a few minutes and i'll make sure you get your plan back at the end laughs
117	t: okay
