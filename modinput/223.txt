301	c: and i'll talk a little bit with you a little bit with your mom and then we'll come in kind of together and see what if anything you guys want to work on when we're done
306	c: fair ?
117	t: fair enough
343	c: okay alright so tell me how do you feel about your ?
112	t: i'm like sometimes like i cry you know like when you go shopping and you really can find like my size
307	c: yeah
106	t: yeah but i've been riding my bike twice a day and walking at night so that's good
308	c: it's really great you're making some changes on your own in terms of your exercise and and what you're drinking
307	c: because it's not always very fun to
328	c: so a little bit is that what you're seeing
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: more about you know happier with your weight so you're doing some things already what made you decide to start doing some ?
112	t: for my 11th my 12th grade year my prom i don want to be like chubby so this is my year i'm in the 11th grade so next summer i should be slowly losing and so in 12th grade i won have to worry about not fitting in a prom dress and stuff
308	c: you have really healthy and realistic kind of goals in your head and not everybody realizes that it takes time
112	t: right and it takes time yeah because i started this august the first so i'm like okay when is i'm going to see something go down you know i'm like you got to wait you got to wait
311	c: so you're ready to kind of put the time and effort in
117	t: yeah
310	c: alright and you're you're weighing yourself on a regular basis to kind of see how it's ?
112	t: no i would like to like weigh myself one time on the first i weighed at 158 and then at the end i want to see if anything changed like i'm going to weigh myself september the first because i started august the first so yeah
311	c: so you're looking at kind of a a once a month
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: weighing pattern to just see how things are going you know i have a little information about you know weighing yourself and keeping your your program in check would you want to hear something like ?
117	t: oh okay
305	c: but you know sometimes it's that if you weigh yourself too frequently because your weight naturally changes
302	c: but you know sometimes it's that if you weigh yourself too frequently because your weight naturally changes over you know some periods and sort of during certain times of the month so sometimes people need a a good month of weighing themselves to see what their body normally does
117	t: mm-hmm
306	c: what do you think about that ?
112	t: i i think i'd like to try it weighing myself like consistently trying to see if anything changes and if it doesn then you keep going
311	c: okay so in your head already you're you're interested in looking at at what you're doing
117	t: right
309	c: pretty healthy attitude towards it
333	c: so what would you you know what are you thinking of doing in order to to take the weight off the healthy ?
106	t: like i said i bike ride i try to eat like for breakfast i'll have like cereal or a banana and like i'll get some pretzels like throughout that until 12 o'clock and then i'll make like a sandwich or something and then eat a meat like my mom made baked fish so we like try and get that kind of thing and just drink water or gatorade
313	c: so you actually have a pretty regular healthy schedule the the way that you're eating
106	t: i'm trying to follow it but yeah some stuff just get through like like i usually wake up like at nine o'clock and go bike riding like this morning i couldn because i had to be here so i woke up at eight and i just danced i try to do something and i try to be active like i don know i'm like and i want to lose this weight so you know you can get your friends because people people judge other people i don like being judged so yeah that's basically it
328	c: so there are some other reasons
117	t: yeah
309	c: around you know hanging out with people and people being mean with your weight too and you made a pretty big adjustment in in what you've kind of made in your plan this morning because you couldn go bike riding so you actually got out of bed earlier so that you could still do your activity that's way cool
117	t: laughs
331	c: well i mean when you think back on the fact that you did get up an hour earlier how does that make you feel about your ability to kind of stick on your ?
106	t: i honestly don know i just like try to stay consistent and constant
308	c: so you're really putting in the time and the effort to to do these things
112	t: yeah i'm not really shocked like now because i want to like be able to like look at september the first and like see like how i was that's when i will see some change because i'm really not seeing any change plus i want to get taller laughs so yeah i'm just waiting for something like to show me that i'm doing something right
328	c: and you want to see some results and while we can you know hoping that you'll get a little bit taller if that's in your genetics but then you're also really working very hard on the exercise part and the eating part
117	t: correct yes
302	c: well a lot of times when i meet with people they put together you know they write down some kind of a plan on what they might really want to focus in on and you have a plan that you're working on right now
117	t: mm-hmm
306	c: how would you feel about kind of writing that stuff ?
119	t: oh i already wrote it down
313	c: so it's something you've already put together
117	t: yeah mm-hmm
343	c: tell me a little bit more about that
106	t: you just like you write it down get a calendar and you mark off what you did that day what you ate and just hoping to see something at the end but i wouldn disappoint myself like by cheating myself yeah
308	c: i am so impressed that you're putting in all this stuff already i mean it's not a lot of people are willing to write stuff down and keep consistent
305	c: and like you said not disappoint yourself because this is all for you
117	t: right
302	c: yeah and that's when people have the most success is when they're really honest with themselves
112	t: like the like ninth grade year ninth and tenth grade year like i said i was going to lose weight but i just played around like okay so now that i saw that not losing weight i added more weight on me and still not doing anything so it's like okay well it's time to get it together
328	c: so it's like kind of your august first was like
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: and you know i have some info in here as far as like different stuff and if it's okay with you i'll just kind of like tell you what's in here
117	t: mm-hmm
305	c: if anything you want to look at or talk about we can or we can you know talk about other stuff because it's your show
302	c: i've got info in here about like portion sizes information on like choosing healthy things when you eat out like in a fast food restaurant and information on beverages you know getting a lot of calories from things that we drink and then some information on activity as well any of those
119	t: yeah when you go to a fast food restaurant do you intake more calories and then try to burn more than you ?
311	c: so you're kind of concerned about how that balance works
117	t: yeah
302	c: well yeah a lot of times when you eat out at fast food restaurants or or other restaurants those foods have more fat and calories in them
117	t: right
309	c: -you know so you know this stuff already
302	c: yeah and so as far as it goes with the balance then yeah you know people a lot of times will need to do more activity more exercise in order to balance out those calories
120	t: okay that was all
305	c: yeah so it kind of fits with what you were thinking mm-hmm and yeah any of those something that you want to take a look at or you're feeling pretty comfortable with what you have and/or taking a look at it later if you ?
101	t: taking a look at it later
309	c: okay alright cool
106	t: i guess just follow through like what you tell me like take it like you said be more active and do this and do that you know just take it as something that i can leave with that when we see each other again if we see each other again you'll be surprised by the way i look
311	c: you're again really looking to the future you really want to find something to really focus on to stick with your plan
117	t: correct
302	c: and a lot of times when i work with people the more specific they can get on what they want to do as far as activity or picking one thing as far as eating that they really want to focus on it can be really helpful for them to be successful
305	c: and you're coming in with so many great things that you're doing and i think a lot of kind of awareness of what works really well for you so i mean what would be something that would really be a good thing for you to focus ?
112	t: myself
311	c: so what what does brianna need to ?
112	t: yeah what does brianna need to do and not what other family members need to do just focus on myself
311	c: alright so have it kind of turn off the noise that's going on ?
331	c: and you know why why do you want to do ? like why does that help you with your weight ?
109	t: because worrying about what they're doing and not worrying about what i'm doing is making me like less because i'm focusing on them while i'm still carrying weight
312	c: okay so it takes away from your efforts to really kind of work on your own weight
117	t: correct
333	c: is this something you want to write ? or it's something you just want to kind of have in your ?
112	t: have it in my head
344	c: okay so what are some things that could get in the way of letting other people do their thing and you do your weight loss ?
120	t: oh i didn understand what did you ?
329	c: -i'll be a little i need to be a little bit more clear ?
344	c: what are some things that could get in the way of you focusing on yourself and your weight ?
109	t: like family members coming in with like a box of pizza mcdonald's chips where i'm like okay i really want this but then again i really want that mcdonald's
333	c: yeah so how you know how do you ignore when the foods kind of come in and they're sitting right next to ? laughs
109	t: i'll tell you a story my mom brought in some krispy kreme donuts after i got off a bike ride so you know your mouth is like watering like mom why would you do ? so we're yelling at each other and i'm like "why would you do ? you know i'm trying to lose ! she's like "i'm sorry i just thought it would be nice" i'm like okay so then you know you tease yourself like oh i really want that but it's just in your head because it's there when something is there and you want it you're going to like go for it but i was happy that my dad took the box out of the house because if he wouldn i would have ate it so that was nice of him
313	c: yeah so it's kind of coming on on both things i mean it came into the house and you really stood up for yourself
109	t: yeah but then we went to taco bell one day and everybody got you know i'm like "this is not healthy what are you guys ? they got their taco bell i just drank my water like okay i really want some taco bell but whatever
313	c: so you actually didn have anything
119	t: no i didn until we got back home
313	c: so you were able to wait
109	t: and peer pressure these people in my house are eating all this junk food bringing it into my face and it's like why are they doing this when they know that i am trying to be on my steady ?
307	c: mm-hmm and that's really frustrating laughs
117	t: yeah
313	c: so that's why the focusing on yourself and kind of ignoring every all the other noise is
117	t: yeah
331	c: well what is is something that either your mom who's here with you or you mentioned some other family members what's something that they could do to help you with your weight loss ?
112	t: don eat it in front of me don bring it inside the house period not even eat it like i'm like okay you guys are going to do this to yourself
311	c: so you're a little bit you're kind of resolved with the fact that they're still going to do some stuff but you would like it if they were a little bit nicer about it
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: alright and how would it go if you talked to them about ? i mean like it sounds like you did already talk to your mom
109	t: mm-hmm they'll say okay and not do it for about a week and then the next week they'll do it again
312	c: so they sometimes stick with it for a little bit
117	t: yes
305	c: now would that be something that you'd like to kind of bring up in here when we come back together as a ?
327	c: so this isn a new thing
109	t: no this is nothing new they know they don do it they don do it a lot now like they don do it a lot
311	c: so it's getting a little bit better
112	t: mm-hmm it's actually working nobody's doing anything it's all good
312	c: okay you know so it's not really something you need to talk to them about right now
101	t: we already talked about it pretty good
312	c: alright well so that kind of side of the things is not something we need to talk about
117	t: uh-uh
331	c: but you know what if anything would be something that your mom could do to help you stay on your ?
112	t: i just you know encourage me motivate me she does but she don do a lot so inaudible
311	c: alright so just a little bit more like go go kind of a thing be your cheerleader for this oh
112	t: we can tell her that when she comes in
301	c: so that's something we can you know inaudible that's something you don mind kind of telling her when we come back together alright well that sounds fair so you know in that case then you know i won necessarily i won you know share with her what you kind of mentioned about bringing the other foods in the house but when we do come back in together i'll let you say that about the encouragement if that's fine
