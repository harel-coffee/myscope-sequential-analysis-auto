301	c: camera's on and they're nothing to worry about; they look at both of us i usually just forget that they're there and i also wanted to let you know that anything you say to me is private and confidential meaning that i won tell people without your permission except if you told me that you were in some kind of danger or putting yourself or someone else or if you let me know that there's an elderly person or a child in some kind of trouble then i'd have to 0:27 that by law c it kind of has to be if you want to make some changes it's got to be your idea ?
306	c: ?
305	c: and i also wanted to let you know that anything
306	c: ?
305	c: we find that telling people what to do or putting a lot of pressure on them to make changes just really doesn work it kind of has to be if you want to make some changes it's got to be your idea
306	c: does that sound ?
117	t: mm-hmm
306	c: alrighty so do you have any questions for me before we get ?
117	t: no
327	c: ? alrighty
301	c: so i guess you know maybe the first thing to do is just to talk a little bit about what you think about your weight
112	t: ooh pause it's like every day people just talk about me
331	c: in what ?
331	c: in what ?
112	t: in a bad way they just call me names
307	c: that must feel pretty rotten
331	c: is this people at school or other places ?
112	t: other places too
328	c: okay so you know so on one hand you feel like you're in a position where you're not really sure what you think about your weight yourself but you know that other people have said some things that aren very nice and that makes you unhappy it sounds ?
306	c: is that ?
307	c: well when people say yucky things to you that you don like very much or that make you feel bad
333	c: what does that make you think about ?
117	t: 2:46 i don know
327	c: you don ? well people think different things when they have somebody who says something not very nice to them some people just kind of let it roll off and say "
302	c: well people think different things when they have somebody who says something not very nice to them some people just kind of let it roll off and say "well they don really know what they're talking about" and other people might get mad and they might go off by themselves some people might decide "you know ? i'm just not going to give them anything to talk about anymore i'm gonna make some changes"
305	c: where do you fall in that list of ? or maybe you do something else
106	t: i'm trying to make some changes
333	c: so what kind of changes have you tried to ?
112	t: losing weight
333	c: mm-hmm can you tell me a little bit about how you've tried to do ?
106	t: i go like there's this gym in my school; we got a treadmill so i go i asked the principal "can i go there during ?
313	c: mm-hmm so you've asked your principal if you can go to the gym during lunchtime at ?
331	c: and have you gotten permission to do ?
333	c: what do you do when you're in the ?
106	t: i get on the treadmill and just lift up some weights
343	c: okay so how's that been going for ?
117	t: good
343	c: can you tell me a little bit more about ?
120	t: and sometimes like in my school if people ask me what's good about emerson i'll just say nothing
345	c: if they i'm sorry if they ask you what's good about ?
120	t: emerson the school i go to
329	c: oh oh okay i got ?
327	c: so if people ask you what's good about your particular school you say nothing
345	c: why do you say ?
328	c: hmm so it sounds like there are a number of things that you wish weren really happening at your school but the good news that i've heard is that you've tried to make the best of it that you've asked your principal for permission to do something that you think will make a difference
331	c: do you feel like it has made a difference so ? what have you seen or felt that has made you think ?
112	t: 'cause like if like people just get on my nerves my family they'll just cheer me back up and start saying good stuff about me
311	c: okay so you feel like you're getting people are saying things you don like very much in a number of areas not just in school well so tell-
301	c: well so tell-i guess you know if i was to help you in some way come up with some ideas that you think might make a difference what kind of ideas do you think that you and i might talk ?
324	c: not ?
301	c: so maybe we could go back for just a minute to this idea that you've done some things at school that you feel like have made a difference
331	c: can you help me to understand what kind of a difference you've ? what specifically has changed for ?
106	t: 6:50 like when i 6:55 principal told me about the gym i'll be asking him every day "can i ? and he'll say "yeah" and plus i stopped eating junk food
309	c: oh ?
313	c: okay so you made two changes
333	c: so may i ask when you stopped eating junk ?
119	t: when i asked about the gym
333	c: okay and how long ago was ?
119	t: when school started
313	c: okay so a couple months ago ?
301	c: can i ask you not to write on the table
309	c: 'cause it's hard to clean off and we try to keep our tables nice and clean
329	c: thank you i appreciate that
328	c: i'll get it later
305	c: so around the beginning of school you made two big changes you started working out in the gym at lunchtime and you stopped eating junk food so how has that been for ?
112	t: it's been better
331	c: yeah in what ?
112	t: 'cause like now when i started going to the gym they don say nothing to me
311	c: okay so people have noticed what you've been doing and they've stopped talking in ways that you don like that must feel pretty good
333	c: so and the junk food you said where have you stopped eating junk ?
120	t: ?
333	c: where have you stopped eating junk ?
119	t: at home
331	c: okay so how were you able to stop doing ? i would imagine that you're probably not the person who does the shopping so did someone help ?
106	t: 'cause like when my family eat junk food they offer me some i just say no
313	c: okay so you've made a personal choice to turn it down when somebody offers you if you want ?
308	c: well that's pretty commendable meaning that i mean that's that really takes a lot of effort for a person to be able to do that pretty successfully
305	c: do you feel like that's something that you want to keep up ? what do you think it might take for you to be able to keep doing those two ?
112	t: i guess mind my own business and whatever people say about you just ignore it
313	c: okay so that's a third change that you've made is you've decided to respond to people differently
120	t: and one day it was one of these boys in my school he just kept calling my name and calling me 9:46 then yesterday i got angry 'cause he just ran up to me and just slapped me so i just got up and just slapped him real hard and the principal said i got suspended 'cause i hit him but he hit me but he didn get suspended
331	c: was that part of your choice for deciding that you would respond differently to ? did that help you make that ?
117	t: yeah
313	c: well these are some pretty big changes that you've made recently do you feel confident that you can keep up with those ?
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: how confident do you ? like if i said "tell me on a scale of one to ten with one being "probably tomorrow i'm not going to do it anymore" and ten being "yup i feel i can do that for the rest of my life"
112	t: ten
308	c: ! that's pretty ?
331	c: what makes you feel like a ten and not a seven or an ?
106	t: because like i look at people when they're eating and the only thing they're eating is sugar and that's when i just every time i go to the store 'cause i usually go to the store every day every time i go to the store they'd think i was getting some ruffles but i just go back there and get me a juice
313	c: okay okay so what you're telling me is that you feel confident at the level of a ten because when you look around ?
302	c: well so when people decide that they would like to work on weight loss they do some of the very same things that you've done they make choices to do something differently and usually people choose to change something about their activity level which you've started doing because you're working out at lunch time and they also decide to change something about the way that they eat which you're doing also because you're cutting out junk food and sugar so if you wanted to keep working on those kinds of things i might be able to help you come up with another idea that you might choose to work on
306	c: would that be ? okay
305	c: so what else do you feel like you might like to work ? what other area do you want to make some changes ?
120	t: mmm like i like at school i just get in trouble for no real reason because this other person is my friend he'll just keep calling me and the teacher going to say i'm getting in trouble 'cause but i'm ain even do nothing 'cause i wasn even talking to him then she'll still say i'm getting in trouble
302	c: mmm yeah that sounds like something really worth checking into to see what the kind of changes you could mak
306	c: is that something maybe that your guidance counselor or social worker at school could help you ?
302	c: okay so maybe that's one step you could take would be to talk to your guidance counselor or social worker about how to not get in trouble when this guy is talking to you and you feel like you're getting blamed for it
305	c: but if you and i were to come up with a plan for something that you would like to work on as far as weight loss goes would you be interested in doing something more as far as activity goes or would you be interested in making a different another change as far as food ?
308	c: or would you be interested in making a different another change as far as food ? i mean i think the ones that you're doing are great but i'd like to help you even more
112	t: as far as activity 'cause i want to do like more activities
330	c: okay
106	t: like i play football but i don like that the football team that i'm playing with 'cause every game we play they'll get mad at me just because i didn catch the ball
312	c: mm-hmm hmm so it sounds as though a lot of the difficulties that you have are related to how people react to you
306	c: is that ?
120	t: ?
312	c: it sounds like a lot of the difficulties that you have are related to how people react to you so you play football and sometimes you don ?
302	c: which is true i think of everybody nobody catches it a hundred percent of the time
306	c: ?
117	t: right
310	c: but are you thinking maybe getting out and practicing a little bit more would be helpful ?
120	t: getting out and practicing a little bit ?
310	c: mm-hmm and that's an idea that can help with weight loss too because the more active you are the more that can help you in two areas ? one with your health and one with how skilled you are at catching the ball ok
302	c: so sometimes when people think about what kinds of changes they want to make they come up with a plan they decide "you know here's what i really want to work on i want to practice more" and then we can either talk about a plan or we could write it down so that you could remember it more easily
305	c: what would be better for ?
112	t: we could write it down
301	c: okay i have a little sheet in here that we can use if that's okay to write it down ?
305	c: and since you can probably put it into your own words better than i can would it be okay if i have you write ?
117	t: mm-hmm
301	c: okay i'll give you something to work on too ? laughs so whoops you know ? i think i gave you the one that i would use for your mom here we go this one's for the teen that's you so this is just a plan that helps people think about what kind of changes they would like to make and you mentioned that you would like to practice football more often and so you might say "my plan is to" and then we can think about like how often do you think would be most helpful to ? for two reasons you mentioned you want to get better at playing football and we also thought about practicing more will help with weight too
333	c: so how often do you think you might ?
106	t: like every day we don have a game we have to practice
333	c: mm-hmm so what would be different that you could do from what you're already ?
302	c: so maybe this will help i have a sheet in here i can show you if that's interesting to you let's see so one of the things that we know about how activity relates to weight loss and in this case it could also be helpful with giving you more practice time is that this is what's recommended for activity if people were to be active three days a week for 60 minutes each day high intensity do you know what that ? it's kind of like if you think about when you are active enough that you can feel your heart beating and like if you were to try to like sing the happy birthday song for example like you wouldn be able to you might be able to say it but you wouldn be able to sing it because you're working that ?
306	c: have you ever been that ?
327	c: so you kind of have an idea of what that might feel like
343	c: so what does your body feel like when you're that active that you can sing the happy birthday ?
302	c: okay so maybe not quite at the level where you're ready to pass out but just before that where you feel like maybe you're sweating and you feel like you're heart's beating and you feel like you could keep going but it's not very easy
109	t: like that
302	c: yeah yeah exactly so some of the things that you might do for that 60 minutes include a warm up so a little bit of stretching your aerobic exercise for the 60 minutes
106	t: i do that too
302	c: and stretching afterwards you do some ? so maybe this will give you some ideas here's another one like walking fast so if you were to and running 'cause that's the kind of stuff that you would do in football ? so those are some different ?
331	c: so if you were practicing where would you do your ?
112	t: there's an open field by the school that i go to
311	c: by the school that you go ? ?
331	c: are you able to get there pretty ?
117	t: mm-hmm
306	c: and it's okay with your family if you ? okay
311	c: okay so you have a place to go you have an idea of what to do
112	t: yeah and like when i was training for kickboxing i live in the same complex with my trainer he'll just take me
311	c: oh okay so you have somebody that could help ? alrighty so i'm going to make sure that you get this sheet so you can refer back to it later and make sure that you remember some of the ideas that we talked about ?
301	c: so i'm going to make sure that you get this sheet so you can refer back to it later and make sure that you remember some of the ideas that we talked about ? so as far as your plan goes you had a plan to practice football more often
112	t: like two hours
306	c: okay and how often are you saying two hours per week or two hours per ?
112	t: two hours per day
302	c: okay so that's even more than what this ?
306	c: are you thinking every day or just certain ?
112	t: every day
332	c: okay is that something you think you'd be able to keep up ? so well you know let's write down your plan ?
327	c: so well you know let's write down your plan then so you could write right here "my plan is to practice football two hours per day" just wanna stick this away 21:25 so we don forget to give it to you
308	c: i like that plan because it helps you to do something that you like and it'll help you out too in a couple areas
331	c: so now the next part is why do you want to do ? why is that important to ?
112	t: 21:56 my throwing i mean to practice on my catching
331	c: what about for weight ? what about that is important for changes in your ?
311	c: i know that you have a couple different reasons why you would like to practice football
118	t: mmm
331	c: so maybe if we take a step back for a minute and think why is it important for you to make changes that will your weight be a healthier ? what are the main reasons for ?
112	t: so i can run better
308	c: okay that's an important one help you do something you really want to do now here's where we think about some of the things that could get in the way and make it difficult for you to be able to do that every ?
311	c: okay so practicing two hours per day is so that you can run better is the main thing that you want to work on right now on top of the nice changes that you've already made
301	c: now here's where we think about some of the things that could get in the way and make it difficult for you to be able to do that every day and if we know what those are and we can plan how you might deal with them if they come then you're more likely to be able to be successful with your plan
306	c: does that make ?
344	c: <cat>302</cat>
345	c: what stopped ?
109	t: my team
332	c: okay so now would your team stop you from practicing on your ?
109	t: yeah 'cause i got to show up to practice every day when i really don want to
312	c: oh okay and i heard you just say something "when you really don want to"
306	c: is that what you ?
312	c: so maybe that's something that might also get in the way here if you do extra practice
332	c: what about if you have a day when you say "you know i said to myself i was going to practice two extra hours a day but i really don want to" could you imagine yourself saying something like ?
323	c: ?
344	c: well what do you imagine might stop you from doing your two hours of extra ?
109	t: school
301	c: okay so you could write that down
330	c: so if school gets in your way
344	c: can you think of anything else that might get in your ?
109	t: friends
308	c: okay that's pretty smart of you to think about these kinds of ?
329	c: i can imagine that they would maybe get in your way sometimes
344	c: can you think of anything ?
323	c: ?
333	c: okay so then now what we do is we think if school gets in your way then try this like what's an alternative something different you could do that would allow you to still do your extra practice even if you have ?
112	t: some days i would have to miss like some days i get a choice if i can either miss school or go to school but i rather go to school than miss it
308	c: mm-hmm that's a pretty smart ?
324	c: i think i'd rather go to school than miss it too
333	c: so okay so let's say that it's not the case that you could just miss school just to practice what else could you do to make sure that you could get your practice in on school ?
112	t: like if i miss practice by the open field i could just go home and go to the park and practice by myself with my other friend
329	c: okay so let's see help me to understand a little bit more about that 'cause i think i might be missing some of what you're talking-it's hard for me to picture what you're talking about 'cause i don know where you live or go to school
109	t: like some days my principal after school he'll tell me and my other friend we got to stay after school for some it's this event coming up in my school we're gonna have to stay after school
306	c: okay so if school gets in your way from practicing what you're really talking about then is if you have to stay after ?
333	c: okay so then what could you do on those ?
112	t: i could practice with my friend when i get back
308	c: oh great write that down that's great what a good solution practice with your friend when you get ?
329	c: i like that idea of maybe just saying "well if i can practice right after school then i can still practice later"
333	c: now what about if you mentioned friends could get in the way of your ? how do you think we could solve that if that becomes an ?
332	c: well maybe the first thing to talk about is how could friends get your way of doing your ?
112	t: go to practice and talk to my friends later
308	c: mm-hmm that's a really nice way to think about it is to just decide that you'll practice first and talk to friends ?
310	c: some people even invite their friends to do the extra practice with them
306	c: is that something your friends would ?
311	c: so now you have two solutions then you might even say invite your friends to do extra practice with you
305	c: what do you think about your plan so ? it's pretty good ? so let's see so the next step says "the first step that i can take in order to reach my goal which is doing extra practice is ? like what's the very first thing you think you need to do to start doing extra practice two hours a ?
106	t: like eat more fruits and vegetables
313	c: okay so eat more fruit and some ?
331	c: and how do you think that that will help you to do your extra ? how do you think that eating more fruits and vegetables will help you to do extra football ?
112	t: like it'll give me more the fruit will give me more energy
309	c: beautiful i like the way you think about these things
301	c: so maybe you could write that there as a reminder "eat more fruits and vegetables because it will give me more energy"
329	c: i like the way you think about these things
301	c: okay then you see what the last line ?
119	t: something 32:33 to help me reach my goals
301	c: yeah so we should probably think about it's-people generally find that it's a little harder to do things when they try to do it all by themselves with nobody helping them so we want people to think a little bit about who could help them who could be supportive to them
112	t: my family
331	c: okay is there any one particular family member that could help ?
112	t: my friend 33:11
311	c: 33:14 ?
331	c: and who in your family could help you ?
112	t: my uncle
331	c: okay and how do you think that those two people could help ?
112	t: well they can get me focused
331	c: okay how do they get you ?
112	t: by like they'll tell me to 33:54 looking at other stuff
328	c: okay pause so now you have a plan in your own words that you're going to practice two extra hours a day for football and you're going to do that so that you can run a little bit better you're going to make s- you have a plan in case some things get in your way and you know who's going to help you you also know the very first step to ?
333	c: so what do you think you might do with this ?
106	t: just work with it and see what i can do
302	c: mm-hmm yeah some people also find that they have to well people have told me that when they hang it up somewhere where they can see it like maybe on their fridge or something that it's helpful because it reminds them every ?
305	c: what do you think that you might do to remind ?
106	t: like when i wake up i can just put it on my wall so when i wake up it'll just be looking in my face
309	c: oh okay good thinking
333	c: so you're going to put it on your wall right where you see it when you first wake up
301	c: okay well so at this point in our meeting we've come up with a good plan for you and in a moment i'm going to talk to is it your mom that came with you ? i'm going to talk to your mom for a few minutes and she and i are going to do something similar is talk through how she can be supportive to you ?
305	c: and it's up to you if you would like to talk about your plan or not do you think that would be a good ?
117	t: mm-hmm
301	c: okay so how do you think we might share your ? and we could do it in two different ways one i can share it with your mom and then we can talk about it again when we come together or you could wait and just share it with her yourself when we come together
119	t: you can share it
301	c: okay so why don i hang on to your plan i'll talk a little bit about it with your mom and then when the three of us come together i'll ask you to tell her what you want to do too ? okay good work thank you
117	t: you're welcome
301	c: so why don we stick this in here and let's see i'm going to take you out to the other room and i'm not sure if our research assistants need to meet with you while i meet with your mom or not if they do they will let you know ? do you want to take your book with ? no okay
