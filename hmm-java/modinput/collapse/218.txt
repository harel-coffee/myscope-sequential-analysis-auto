301	c: let's see okay so i did want to just start by telling you just that we're being videotaped they told you that in the consent form that that's to kind of see how i'm talking and figure out the best way to talk to teens about weight
306	c: any questions about ?
305	c: okay and the other thing to just say that today might be a little different than other times you've talked to people about weight because i'm not here to tell you what to do or how to do it really this about figuring out what it is that you want and what it is that you want to be different if anything after today
306	c: so what questions do you have about ?
117	t: mmm not right now
301	c: not right now okay so i'll meet with you first and then i'll meet with your mom and then we'll come back together to kind of figure out a plan for what you might want to do next
343	c: alright so tell me what you know sort of where you're at with your weight
119	t: right now i'm at well i'm just now i was at 306
343	c: okay what do you think about that ?
112	t: i'm not too happy with it i want it to be way lower than it is now
311	c: okay so you'd want your weight to be lower than it ? and you weren happy when you saw where it ?
117	t: no
331	c: okay do you have a goal in mind or what are your goals around your ?
112	t: at least to get it back down in 200 at least or even lower
311	c: okay so you have a number in mind that you'd like to drop about 100 pounds or maybe even ?
117	t: yeah
331	c: so where are you at in terms of how ready you are to do ? you know are you like if you think of a scale from one to ten are you totally ready to make changes right now or are you sort of a one would be "i'm not ready to make changes right now" or somewhere in the ?
112	t: somewhere in the middle
345	c: okay like a five or six ?
112	t: mm-hmm i think six
311	c: about a six okay
331	c: so tell me why a six and not a lower ?
103	t: because i've been struggling with my weight for awhile since i was maybe late elementary sixth grade or so
311	c: okay so it's been a struggle for you and you it sounds like a five or six not a one or two because you want to do it but maybe not a higher number because it's been so hard for you
305	c: so did i get that ?
117	t: yes
325	c: okay so it sounds like it's really like if you think about like motivation you know being like you know whether you want to do it whether it's important to you or whether you feel confident it sounds like it's pretty important you're just not sure how confident you are that you can make it happen
117	t: yeah
323	c: okay alright when we talk about weight you know there's different things you can do in terms of getting your weight down what kinds of things have you thought ?
106	t: i'm actually involved in sports in my school like i do right now i'm doing conditioning for volleyball
330	c: oh okay
109	t: but i recently started working so it was like last week was like my last week of doing it i don mind getting back my work schedule is kind of
325	c: okay so you were involved with sports and the conditioning for volleyball and volleyball is something you play during the school ?
117	t: yeah
333	c: okay and what about in the area of food and food ?
109	t: my appetite i don have a huge appetite i actually eat less than some others i don know i think it's what i eat not how much i eat but yeah that's the problem
311	c: okay so you're thinking that there might need to be changes in terms of the food choices not so much the amounts for you it's more the ?
117	t: mm-hmm
343	c: mm-hmm so what about the food ? tell me more about that
103	t: with the food choices like sometimes when we're on the go we go pick something up not at home like when i'm in town with my dad he doesn cook that much so we eat out a lot when i'm with him
314	c: okay so eating out fast food are the kinds of things that you think might be influencing your ?
117	t: yes
331	c: okay and why do you want to lose ?
112	t: because i feel like i'll feel better more comfortable in different situations and i'll just feel much better
311	c: okay so it sounds like you're going to feel better physically and there's also an element of emotionally about feeling more comfortable in situations maybe not as self-conscious
117	t: yes
331	c: okay so those are two important reasons for you anything else about why you want to lose ?
112	t: it'll make my mom happy and my family happy to see
311	c: okay so your family is concerned about your weight and you think it'll make them happy if you lose
331	c: is that a reason or is that just more what they ? is that important to you to make them ?
112	t: it's important for me to make them happy but i also want to make myself happy with making the changes like
311	c: okay so the more important thing for you is to make yourself happy right now and so even though sort of as a side effect your parents you know your family might be happy really you want to do it for you physical and the emotional benefits of losing ?
117	t: yes
328	c: yeah well you know you've mentioned physical activity and you've mentioned nutrition as two areas you know that you've thought about one is about the food choices and one is about just being active in sports
305	c: and you know which one of those or both of those are areas that you actually would like to talk about changing you know ?
106	t: my exercising like working out with my sports in school i actually do more than just one sport basketball and yes i do basketball and after i stopped my mom was like "oh your weight shot back up let's get you involved with something else" then she noticed like when the off season that's when i gained my weight back 'cause i lose a lot of weight during the season and then i gain it back in the off season so
310	c: mmm so you've noticed actually quite a bit of weight loss success when you're active with sports and the way your body type is the minute you stop exercising it's like sort of right back ?
117	t: yeah
310	c: okay and so you know one thought is to continue to try to find ways to exercise even when you're not in sports the other choice is to cut back on your eating when you're not being as active
305	c: so which one of those would you want to talk about today if ?
120	t: sorry what's the ?
303	c: either so it sounds like because you are losing weight when you're active with sports and so it seems like you either your choice is to either be active with sports all the time or to cut your food your calories when you're not you know when you're in the off season
112	t: i think i prefer to cut back on the calories more because i have a busy schedule outside of sports and stuff so i think cutting back on the calories and stuff would help me out a lot with managing my weight
305	c: okay so rather than come up with an exercise plan every day you'd rather focus on the cutting of the calories right ? okay alright 'cause you know we only have you know today to talk and so you know obviously there's lots of different things you can do but it's going to be you know it seems like focusing on one thing that you maybe can accomplish right now might be you know worthwhile for you and you want to look at the cutting ?
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: and so let's talk about that a little bit what are your thoughts about cutting ?
112	t: i mean i don mind trying something new but i don want to make a big dramatic change right now just stop eating something yeah
328	c: okay so you this is something you really want to do and you really want to make a change but you're worried that this sort of dramatic like huge thing is not something you can accomplish right now and you've already said you've tried and tried and tried so many things and it doesn work and maybe you're on to something maybe making some small changes might have more success
117	t: yeah i think so
311	c: you think so for you rather than like a big dramatic change kind of some gradual ?
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: alright well i do have some information here about ideas that we could talk about or maybe you have some of your own ideas about what you might want to change
305	c: what would you ?
112	t: some of those
302	c: to take a ? okay alright so i'm going to leave all this stuff with you 'cause this is some other exercise ideas and stuff but you wanted to focus on the nutrition so exercise so okay so why don we just go through kind of get a bird's eye view of all these and then you can see which one or two or if any you want to maybe think about
117	t: okay
302	c: okay so this one talks about drinks and the different calories that are in drinks
331	c: what do you know about how many calories you'd need to cut in order to lose ?
119	t: i'm not exactly sure
302	c: okay so one piece of information that might be helpful is even to know how much you would need so would you like me to talk to you a little bit more about ?
117	t: yes
302	c: okay so a pound of weight is 3500 calories basically that's a whole pound so if you were going to lose a pound a week what we do is we basically divide this by seven days so i don know if math is your best thing but seven divided by 3500 or 3500 divided by seven is 500 calories a day
306	c: so i'll just put that up here okay so what does that mean to ?
112	t: i don think that's a lot
302	c: okay so cutting 500 calories a day doesn seem like that much to you right now so let's keep that in mind when you kind of take a look at this so here's drinks any kind of sugar drink pretty much will be about a hundred calories a drink so i don know you know that's one think to think about the other thing so even like juice you know even fruit juice is 120 calories for a cup so that's one area then we talk about fast food and you could see here there's lots of things that have 500 calories even like just a fried chicken sandwich is 800 for example so if you cut that out or substitute it with a 300 calorie you know sandwich you would like if you substituted well here's a garden salad with grilled chicken instead of the fried chicken that would be 500 right there or let's say you had a grilled chicken sandwich instead of fried chicken that would be 300 and then you'd only need to cut out like a drink or two you know what i'm ? so let's see what ? and then there's the portion sizes which is you know basically tells you you know how much like portions the different calories are and to cut your portions so those are some different areas that you could look at
305	c: maybe you have another idea in terms of the 500 ?
117	t: no i don know
305	c: 'cause it's really up to you you know i mean a lot of people try to put people on diets but that can be pretty drastic and it doesn fit necessarily with your life so if you think about your you know typical day you could pick something or maybe you could tell me what you eat in a typical day and we could talk about where might be the best way best place
103	t: well for breakfast i usually kind of skip breakfast 'cause i'm usually trying to get ready for the day so i'll skip that for lunchtime i might eat a late lunch maybe at one even two o'clock sometimes like today i haven ate anything 'cause i was rushing to get back home and didn have a lot of time so yeah
302	c: some kids find that when they skip meals they get really hungry and then they eat more at the next meal is that something that ?
117	t: yeah yes it is
302	c: okay so another possibility is to add like some small meals early on so that you don overeat you know at your next meals that's another thought
333	c: so for 500 a day what are you thinking about ?
109	t: i drink juice but not a lot of it maybe i'm not sure actually 500 i'm not sure what i could cut
330	c: okay
120	t: i'm trying to remember what
345	c: what you ?
117	t: yeah
331	c: yeah how much do you know about the calories in what you're ? is that something that you've been pretty educated about or is it something that you're not really sure ?
109	t: i'm not very educated with the calories in the different foods that i eat i really don know like especially going out fast food eating i really don know what the calories are in some of the food
326	c: are right right okay so one of the things that may get in the way of cutting the 500 calories is you don really know how much you're eating in terms of calories
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: okay well some people find it helpful to for awhile to record
305	c: what they eat and how many calories is in their food to kind of see you know what that looks like i'm not sure what you think about that idea if that's something you'd want to do or if you'd rather just pick a couple of substitutions
112	t: i would rather pick substitutions
309	c: okay you're kind of trying to think realistically about what's going to go on in your life and that's really important
334	c: well you mentioned substituting juice and i'm not sure do you drink soda pop at all ?
106	t: not that often as how i used to
313	c: okay so you've already made some changes in that
334	c: so one is to just be drinking water as one possibility you've mentioned fast food you know how often would you say that you eat fast ?
103	t: in a week depends on how the week is probably once or twice
343	c: okay and what kinds of things are you eating the rest of the ?
106	t: when i'm at home and my mom makes dinner she probably makes chicken or something and she usually bakes it now she don usually fry it how much she used to 'cause it's hot outside summer she may barbecue some chicken chicken and probably baked beans or something like that
311	c: mm-hmm what about the it sounds like the actual eating out once or fast food is only once or twice a week and when your mom makes dinner she's cooking actually pretty healthy right ?
117	t: yes
334	c: okay what about sweets and snacks and chips and those kinds of ?
103	t: well she does buy chips and stuff for us for me and my family i mostly eat chips like during lunchtime i might have a sandwich and some chips and yeah
310	c: okay so that it sounds like that might be a potential place to also cut some calories
306	c: is with the chips what are your thoughts about ?
112	t: i mean i don mind but i would still like to have some
305	c: right 'cause you already said you don want to cut anything out completely
343	c: so what about portion sizes with those ? like so for example if it's lunchtime and you're having chips you know do you find that you could eat half a bag of chips like that snaps or do you find that you just eat a couple and stop or you ?
103	t: with chips i probably eat like start with two handfuls not half a bag just i don a lot
325	c: okay so it sounds like you're not really still really not sure you know where would be the best place to cut those calories
109	t: i'm not actually sure where
331	c: what's your best guess about where you know where most of your weight comes ?
103	t: not enough activity like i might eat and like sit down get sleepy and i might go to sleep
112	t: i'm thinking that maybe walking around doing some housework or even going outside would help me
328	c: so it sounds like you maybe you know that 500 calories you can cut by cutting food but you can also burn by getting more active so what you're saying is maybe it would be better to do like a little bit of each you know like cut back a little bit of food like cut out juice or maybe a little bit smaller portion at dinner but then also be a little bit more active at the same time so that you're burning at the same time but you also don want to like work out at a gym you want to kind of more just like go outside for a walk or just maybe or maybe watch less-sit around less is what you're ?
117	t: mm-hmm yeah
305	c: okay so what i'm hearing is you don want to make sweeping changes but maybe a little bit of change in each of these ?
306	c: did i get that ?
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: okay some kids find it helpful to write down the goals that they're making and other kids prefer just to talk about them
305	c: what would you ?
112	t: probably write it down would be a little better
302	c: okay 'cause i have this goal sheet here somewhere inaudible oh no she gave us this one twice okay alright i got two parent ones by accident laughs let me go see if she can grab me a regular one and then we can continue that
329	c: okay sorry about that
305	c: i want to make sure you had a good one so it wasn crossed out okay so do you want to write or would you like me to ?
112	t: um you can write
333	c: okay so your plan is to so what are the kind of behaviors that you talked about trying to ?
106	t: eating less no not eating less portion size
313	c: okay so smaller portions
106	t: and more activities exercising
313	c: more activities
333	c: and when you say more activities what are you thinking about ?
106	t: walking probably
333	c: ?
106	t: let's see i work out on the wii
333	c: okay so trying to do that maybe everyday instead of every once in ?
305	c: okay is that what you're thinking ?
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: yeah 'cause i know the wii you know you can get moving on it; the problem is some people end up pulling it out like once a week or you know it's kind of getting in the habit
328	c: so walking and the wii and it sounds like it's something that you want to try to incorporate a little everyday you know instead of like a big huge workout plan but maybe just a little bit everyday you know would fit better for you alright and you mentioned the juice cut out juice
117	t: yeah
333	c: and what would you drink instead ?
106	t: water my mom buys bottled water like all the time
311	c: oh okay there's a lot of bottled water around for ?
117	t: mm-hmm
311	c: okay so water instead
331	c: and why do you want to do ?
112	t: 'cause i feel like i'll feel better
331	c: feel better and be less ?
117	t: yes
313	c: okay you mentioned something else about not sleeping right after you eat
117	t: mm-hmm
344	c: okay move after eating how about does that make ? okay move after eating okay so what do you think might get in the way of starting this you know ? let's say like okay today you're going to leave here and you've been rushing around and you haven eaten you're probably getting hungry you know what could get in the way of now going out and you know either eating the smaller portions and doing walking right after you ?
109	t: probably work
312	c: work okay
117	t: yeah
344	c: so tell me more about that
109	t: well i go to work it's like at ten i go in at ten
332	c: at ?
120	t: no morning
312	c: okay ten in the morning okay okay
109	t: laughs and i probably leave around seven
345	c: and where are you ?
120	t: at a braiding shop
310	c: a braiding shop okay so you go to work at ten and you leave at seven and you have to plan on food during the day
117	t: yes
333	c: so how do you manage ? or how will you manage that ?
106	t: try to bring stuff on my own
313	c: okay so you're going to bring food from home which requires some preparing
333	c: and planning ?
117	t: yes
333	c: so are you a morning person where you're up before work or do you kind of roll out of bed and go right to ?
120	t: i'm up before work yeah
331	c: okay so planning to pack food before you go to work is something realistic 'cause you're usually up in ?
117	t: yeah
302	c: okay other people you know have to do it the night before 'cause they kind of roll out of bed and go but it sounds like you'll be able to manage that
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: are there what are your thoughts about having food around the house that is easy to pack and ?
112	t: maybe fruit
328	c: okay okay and so pre-packing the chips in small portions is something that sounds like small portions of chips and that's something your mom can do which is having that food ?
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: mm-hmm are there any other substitutes to chips that have lower calories that you ? you know like crackers or triscuits or wheat thins or you know popcorn or anything like ? or would you rather just do a smaller portion of what you really ?
112	t: a smaller portion of what i like so
311	c: as long as maybe switching it out on some days okay so some alternatives to chips but maybe not everyday but like mixing it up
117	t: mm-hmm
328	c: okay so your work schedule could potentially also interfere with you being active although you're not going to go to sleep after you eat at work you'll be standing 'cause with braiding you have to you're on your feet right most of the time
333	c: so what are your thoughts about you know being active when you come home or before in the ?
112	t: when i get home i'm usually tired and kind of i don know sleepy but in the morning i could probably get up and go on a wii or walk around
333	c: okay so if you have to be at work at ten what time do you have to get up to have time to be active and pack your ?
106	t: probably wake up around eight around
331	c: do you live close to work or pretty ?
112	t: yeah i can walk to work
308	c: oh perfect
333	c: okay and you're walking to ?
117	t: yeah
313	c: so that's another thing okay so up at eight to be active and pack food
333	c: so you just set an alarm for eight o'clock or would you wake up ?
112	t: i have an alarm
331	c: okay you're an alarm ?
117	t: mm-hmm
313	c: okay to be active and pack food
333	c: okay is this something you feel like you can do on your own or that you'd need reminders ?
112	t: i don need a reminder just an alarm clock you know with the time i need to wake up inaudible
313	c: okay so i'm going to add set alarm
305	c: okay what's the first step you can do to reach this goal ? or today when you get ?
112	t: maybe getting stuff prepared before maybe can help me out
313	c: okay so you're going to get like make sure the wii is all set up and you know get everything prepared for-'cause it sounds like it's the morning that's going to be the best time for you to do this
117	t: yes
311	c: okay you've mentioned that your mom can help you by having fruit and healthy food to pack
331	c: any other things that you can think about that she might be able to help ?
112	t: far as getting like having stuff at home we have some stuff at home but maybe if she tried some different sometimes i go to the grocery store with her but i don know maybe different things i would go choose alternatives
310	c: okay so maybe at least one time going to the grocery store with her to kind of prepare for some of these changes that you want to make
312	c: okay you mentioned not being sure all the time about the calories and there is some information in here
331	c: what do you know about looking at the back of food labels to see ?
112	t: i know how to read like the back of them you know the calories and
308	c: okay so it sounds like you have some really good ideas about what might work for you that these drastic changes you know you've sort of tried before and they're hard to stick to and you've been struggling with this for a long time and you really want to make this happen for yourself
328	c: i mean your family also will be happy but you want to be happier you want to feel better physically and emotionally and you've identified some small changes that you could make that might make a difference bringing food from home when you go to work or school down the road or what have you smaller portions of the unhealthy things like the chips getting up at eight o'clock to be active and packing food and setting your alarm and those are all kind of small things that you think you can do right now
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: on a scale from one to ten how confident are you that you can make these things ? one is like not at all confident and ten is "i'm definitely doing this" where are you ?
112	t: laughs probably about a eight
311	c: okay so you're about an eight you're pretty confident that this could work for you
331	c: and why did you say an eight and not a lower ?
106	t: because i feel like tomorrow i'm starting tomorrow i can start doing my schedule 31:40
305	c: okay it sounds like you know because you made this yourself you know that it's something that you feel pretty confident you could do
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: okay what would it take to get you to a ?
112	t: see different like results with my weight decreasing "oh i lost a pound or maybe two" i can keep doing it a little more
311	c: okay so you'd like to see some benefit and some ? and weighing yourself is one way you think you could monitor those outcomes
331	c: what is your ability to weigh yourself at ?
119	t: a ?
331	c: yeah i mean do you have ?
112	t: yes i have the wii one and we have another one
311	c: oh wii fit has the whole setup
117	t: right
302	c: you could even do that tonight and set that all up on the wii fit okay so you got the wii fit scale a couple things about monitoring your weight that i can share with you if you're interested
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: if you are going to weigh yourself everyday which is good
309	c: you know if you're on the wii fit everyday you have to realize though that weight does go up and down so that if one day you're three pounds heavier than you were the previous day that doesn mean that everything's not working you know your weight can change from water or from having your period or from the heat clothes that you're wearing
302	c: so what do you think of that ?
119	t: it sounds about accurate 'cause the wii says that too
303	c: alright so then what you want to do is you know like you're saying if you're weighing yourself everyday kind of see where you are at the end of the month you know before you make a decision that "ohh you know this plan isn working" laughs
117	t: yeah
309	c: okay alright so it sounds like you know a fair amount about this stuff and
303	c: it's just a matter of getting started with some small changes in the off season 'cause you know when you're in the on season it's a little easier for you you know the other thing that sometimes happens with athletes is that when they are off season it's hard to adjust your food so when you're on season you're hungry a lot you're active and you're eating and then you go off season and it's hard to adjust
117	t: mm-hmm
305	c: so it sounds like that's something you've noticed with yourself that you want to keep an eye on
117	t: yes
301	c: okay next i'm going to meet with your mom so we have a couple of options i can share this plan with her i can maybe just talk to her about the plan or i cannot share anything and just kind of see what she thinks
305	c: what would you ?
112	t: she can look at it
301	c: okay well what i'll probably do is more talk to her and then when you guys come back together you know you can share it with her
117	t: okay
305	c: so it sounds like that's okay with you
117	t: mm-hmm
301	c: alright okay sounds good then let me walk you out or well actually i think you go into the next room and then i'll switch with your mom
