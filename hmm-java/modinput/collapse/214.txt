311	c: mm-hmm so you've become less social because of your weight and you don like that either it feels that's not you would prefer to be able to meet new people and feel comfortable but because of your weight you worry that people are going to be talking about you

117	t: yes
333	c: what would you say the difference ? like how much fast food you were eating before and how much in the last two ?

308	c: okay so that's a big change
117	t: yes
333	c: how did you manage that ?
106	t: by like spending less budgeting my money and stuff going to the fast food restaurants
313	c: okay so one is you're trying to save your money and that's another advantage and you just stopped going
117	t: yes
119	t: c: okay were you going by yourself before or were you going with other people ? i was going with other people
333	c: okay so how do you say ? if your friends are like "okay we're going to mcdonald's we're going here" how did in the last two weeks how have you managed to say ?
106	t: like telling them that i don want to eat there and we'd be better off eating at home yeah or if they go then i'll just tell them that i don want to eat there
313	c: okay and so you've been able to to tell your friends that that's not what you want to do
117	t: yes
343	c: and how have they ?
112	t: they'll say okay
311	c: so they've been supportive of that

106	t: well my mom just bought me a scale so and i look in the mirror
313	c: okay so your mom just bought you a scale which will allow you to kind of really see if the weight's coming off
117	t: yes
331	c: okay did you notice anything from the weight on the scale to your weight ? what did you ?
119	t: because like when i went to the doctor's i was like 280 but i don know my weight now

309	c: inaudible things so that's really good
302	c: and then if you can you know this is another suggestion which would be to add on the other days a little bit of aerobic with some stretching or strength or things like that
