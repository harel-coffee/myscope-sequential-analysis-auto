330	c: we'll figure out the best way to talk to teens about about weight
117	t: okay
345	c: things like that so do you have any questions about ?
117	t: hmm no
330	c: ? okay
112	t: i think i can do it
311	c: you think you can do ? alright you're confident
305	c: so the other thing i wanted to tell you this might be different than other kinds of weight conversations you've had because i'm not here to tell you what to do or how to do it or give you a specific diet i really want to know what you think and what it is you might want to change if anything
117	t: okay
343	c: okay so tell me you know where you're at with your weight and what your thoughts are about ?
112	t: i would like to do more but i don have a lot of stuff like to do only thing i have is a basketball hoop i pull it out like every day and it's heavy
327	c: uh-huh laughs so you're dragging it out
119	t: it's about 100 pounds
308	c: oh my goodness okay you must be strong
106	t: so i do that every day i probably play for about 30 to an hour with my uncles and my friends okay and sometimes we'll go to the store inaudible i'll get a juice or something and come back mm-hmm if he want to play i'll probably play and we go back i'll play basketball for another hour okay so we do that about every day but he's going out of town so i'm trying to sharpen up on my skills a little
313	c: okay you're practicing for getting ready for when he comes back
106	t: yeah and that's about i play my game for about two hours and then i quit and i'll go back back or help my dad work on a couple cars okay because he owns his own business okay that's like my every day life
328	c: so you you play basketball you play your games i mean like your video games for a couple hours and you help your dad you might go to the store get some juice and being active is something you want to do it's important to you yes and you want to try to even be maybe even more active than you are right now okay
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: and so you know i'm wondering are you are you is your weight something you're concerned about not really worried about somewhere in the ?
112	t: a little but now since when i help my dad we're going to start getting home earlier because we usually get home about one o'clock in the morning oh okay and stuff so if we get home earlier me and my brother we might like go jogging or ride bikes so when it's cool mm-hmm we'll go get me a sweat off inaudible
330	c: okay
109	t: and we usually like last night got home around 12:30 and he just said he tired
326	c: yeah it's kind of late for jogging
117	t: yeah so
325	c: so you know i'm hearing that you're a little bit concerned about your weight but you're not sure really if it's that big of a deal
117	t: yes ma'am
306	c: okay did i get that ?
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: okay i i do have some information here about where your weight is compared to other kids your age if you'd like to take a look at it okay so basically did they tell you what your weight was when you got ? like 242
306	c: yeah it was 242 and what that means is that if you were going to look at you know 100 kids your age you're 13 ? your bmi which is your weight for height would be up around here actually it's maybe even a little a little higher and what that means is that for your height and weight your bmi is much higher than most kids your age is that a surprise not a surprise ?
109	t: yeah a little but the last time i came to the hospital they put me on steroids okay and i was on steroids when i was a little boy i usually be average but when i started taking them i got bigger
312	c: okay so you attribute a lot of your weight being to the steroids that they put you on mm-hmm okay
119	t: and i quit i lost a little then i came back because when i had the earache they tried to put me on steroids i said
312	c: no way okay so when you stopped the steroids you lost some weight and now you're back on
117	t: yes
332	c: or you're back up a little bit even though you haven been on steroids okay and the steroids what were the steroids ?
119	t: i had asthma okay and like they gave me this breathing machine mm-hmm because when i was a little boy i had asthma attacks mm-hmm and when i got on the breathing machine i never had one again
311	c: okay so it it sounds like at first you thought that most of the weight gain was due to the steroids and that kind of put you on that track but now maybe you're a little bit more worried because you've gained some weight and you're not on steroids
117	t: yes
331	c: okay and what are what do you know about the risks or the health problems that you can get if your weight stays ?
112	t: working out more i can do that okay running
311	c: so you're really really motivated to exercise
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: and try to get this weight off and what are some reasons why you want to get the weight ?
109	t: teasing like uh-huh because i'm a big guy and some might tease me i take that offensively and i don want to get in trouble i never fought in my life which i i could have but i avoided it
311	c: okay so you're trying to stay away from fighting and you're worried if you if your weight stays high you get teased and that could lead to fights and then you'd get in trouble
117	t: yeah
331	c: and you don want to go down that path okay what are some other reasons why you want to get the weight ?
112	t: so i can do more stuff
311	c: okay so you know that when you're if you're not as heavy that you might have more energy and you can do more things
302	c: okay this sheet i'll leave it with you has some other information about like other risks like diabetes and heart conditions and things that you can get if your weight stays high so i'll just leave those for you
305	c: but for you you know it's not so much the health specifically but you want to do more things and you don want to be teased anymore and those are important
109	t: because my brother he wanted me to play football inaudible and then when i decided he was going to call his friend because his friend was a coach he never called him and he on me like "why ain you ? i was like "it's your fault i told you to call him"
330	c: mm-hmm
112	t: asked you twice and so but now he's going to start running around the track my daddy my daddy said if he do have a little of the diabetes or on the borderline he's going to get us two inside a gym where we can wake up around five or four o'clock in the morning and go to the gym
311	c: okay so basketball running
331	c: it's too late for football now with the coaches or ?
112	t: yeah but me and my brother we said we're going to start to workout in like the winter okay and i got a little weight bench too okay gets you a little stronger at home so
311	c: so you want to work on getting some weights and your dad said that he's going to help maybe consider joining a gym yes also because he worries about his own diabetes
109	t: it's hard to find a gym for me and him
326	c: it's hard to find a gym you can both go to mm-hmm okay
106	t: so what if what i can do if i'm going to start going i'm going to go get the treadmill from my uncle okay because i'm going to start walking then i'll move to jogging then i'll move to running just to get my legs stronger and me a little stronger
308	c: alright so you already have some really good ideas of kind of how to kick it up a notch
328	c: you're already doing basketball but you want to kick it up a notch and you there's some things that you have to rely on other people for joining a gym and your brother for the jogging but you've thought about some things you can do on your own which is your own weight bench and you mentioned a treadmill
117	t: yes
331	c: tell me more about the treadmill how are you going to get ?
112	t: well we have a truck okay my uncle has it and he hasn used it in about two years okay he let my other uncle see it he hasn used it okay i'm pretty sure i'm going to use it but our basement is kind of small so okay we got the weight bench here we probably got to move the treadmill here
345	c: okay so one thing maybe to talk to your mom about is that your mom in the other ?
117	t: yes
311	c: is you know how you might be able to manage getting a treadmill in the house
117	t: okay
302	c: so you can work on that because i have some information here too there's all kinds of things here we don need to look at all of them i just want to pick out the ones that really match what you're telling me and what you're telling me is you want to focus on physical activity and this here talks about what they what's recommended for weight loss is that something you might want to take a look ? yes mm-hmm so three days a week of high intensity and then four days a week mixing up you know aerobic with strength and stretching
117	t: okay
311	c: and it sounds like that's something you really want to do
112	t: yeah i've been trying to get the wii fit for the last christmas
330	c: uh-huh uh-huh
109	t: then they sold out
327	c: uh-huh i remember right after christmas it was gone
112	t: so uh-huh this x-box 360 thing play station 3 thing i have both systems you know they came out with a new thing where it goes off your body right right so if i get that i might get to be a little bit more active on the game
311	c: so that's another idea is to use a game to get more active
117	t: yes
331	c: okay and the i'm wondering with the treadmill and the strength and stuff what are your what are your thoughts about doing that getting into that every ?
324	c: you seem a little hesitant
109	t: i want to do it mm-hmm tell you the truth but it's like i want to go help my dad and he own the business and i kind of worry because i saw what happened to businesses so
326	c: so you've got a lot of things on your mind yeah mm-hmm and you've got other things that you want to take care of besides just working out okay
112	t: but i really want to do it
305	c: but you really want to you want to make time for this you want to make time for an hour a day
117	t: yeah
330	c: and you think that it is something you can do and still help your dad out and do what you the other things and school is starting soon
112	t: yeah i'm supposed to be going to a different school mm-hmm because i was confident about losing weight but my last school we probably go to gym once a week because they took our gym away from us to give to the seventh graders oh so i'm going to a new school we have swimming gym football soccer
311	c: so you're even going to go to a school that's more active
112	t: basketball yeah and you get more education skills we probably stay at school for about an hour two hours longer to learn a little more oh okay and
311	c: so you you sound pretty confident that this school change is also going to help with your weight loss because you're going to be more active
117	t: yes
331	c: okay what about your ? what about your food and drink ? is is have you thought about making any changes in that ?
112	t: yes i have
311	c: you have okay
117	t: because
343	c: tell me about that
109	t: since my dad's working on the business i go down there like every day mm-hmm we like we don he has a refrigerator but he keep bad stuff
312	c: oh okay so there's a lot of junk food at the at the business
109	t: and sometimes i be hungry mm-hmm i just go grab a water or a juice mm-hmm but sometimes i'll be hungry i'm just going to forget it i'll just wait until i go home and right i probably wait about another three to four to five hours
312	c: so you wait so long and then you get home and you're starving
109	t: yes and he's like boy you ain starving and it's like i'm like i'm a kid yeah i play basketball i help you like if i can i'll go get a salad or something
312	c: right but if you're starving and then you go home you're going to grab whatever you've got there and right that might not be so good
112	t: and sometimes we don have anything in the refrigerator so he talk about going shopping tonight like he wanted me to come here first uh-huh and then go shopping to get what we need okay so because he said he want to lose
328	c: it sounds like you've caught you've thought about some things some really good things that might help one is having healthy foods at the business so that you don have to starve yourself and maybe keeping some of the bad foods out of the refrigerator the other is having healthy foods at home so that when you get home
112	t: i can have something
311	c: you can have some choices of things to eat okay
112	t: because me and my brother reeves he have the blender mm-hmm we usually probably make strawberry smoothies stuff like that
311	c: mm-hmm so you can eat more fruits and vegetables that way
117	t: yes
311	c: you also mentioned a couple times drinking water or juice
112	t: water don have any sugar right juice does like but i try to get some diet sometimes
302	c: sometimes okay i have some information here about drinks if you want to see those
117	t: mm-hmm
306	c: it's interesting because the juice a lot of people think that it's it's better than soft drinks but like you already know that juice has a lot of sugar so if basically if you drink a liter or more of these beverages any of these including juice that's four cups a day if you cut that out you could lose a pound a week so even though it seems like a little bit of juice a little but you know not a big deal you drink four cups of any of these drinks a day that's a pound so i don know what do you think about about that ?
109	t: i like the gatorade gives you energy too
302	c: mm-hmm gatorade is can give you energy but again most gatorade is going to have the same calories so here oh here it is sports drinks it's a little bit less but than juice than juice but still is definitely you know some more than than the water
112	t: okay good they came out with a new gatorade it's called low calories
301	c: yeah it's like 30 calories for a cup
333	c: have you tried ?
117	t: yeah mm-hmm
331	c: what'd you ?
109	t: it's okay it's not as good as the other one right if i have to drink it i
311	c: you think you can find a substitute okay so
112	t: i kind of like it but
310	c: yeah the it's it's it's like it doesn taste horrible it might not be your first choice but it's a good second choice
117	t: right yeah
328	c: okay so to summarize you know you cell phone rings
329	c: sorry about that
328	c: you you're interested in losing weight you want to do it because of teasing and because of you want more energy and do more things you have already come up with a couple of ideas you want to increase your activity physical activity by adding the treadmill that seems to be the most realistic thing right now you've got other ideas like school and and the x-box but right now the treadmill is what you think you can actually do now maybe your dad will join a gym all of those are maybes but the treadmill
106	t: i'm i'm going to try to force him
313	c: you're going to try to force him so we can bring that up with your mom about the gym as another
118	t: hmm it's
324	c: ?
109	t: it's yes okay i can but it's like i want to go home at a decent time but mm-hmm he's so busy and my brother is so busy we do not have transportation i see to get there and
326	c: so getting to the gym is another barrier with the gym
109	t: my no not like the gym i'm pretty sure we can wake up at five o'clock in the morning but when we go to the building i don want to stay down there until like oh okay 12
326	c: the problem is is once you get to your dad's you're stuck there
117	t: yeah
333	c: okay and what about when school ? what happens with ?
109	t: still at the same time so you go there and like 12 o'clock so what i do i go there make me a little thing in the chair upstairs i go to sleep there
307	c: i see so that's really hard
117	t: yeah
331	c: mm-hmm and what's your mom doing during that ?
120	t: at home
332	c: mm-hmm but she doesn have ?
112	t: she has transportation she's looking for some stuff to do too like me and her she want to come and get more active and stuff too
328	c: okay so it sounds like the being at your dad's late at night is really something that gets in the way of your health plan yes and you mentioned your mom is home
117	t: mm-hmm
331	c: what what gets in the way of her bringing you ?
109	t: well it don gets in the way because she go out with her friends and when she come back she don have a lot of gas uh-huh so
331	c: so what are your thoughts about when we i'm going to talk to your mom next about how to help you okay what do what do you think about bringing something like that up with her about getting you home ? would that be okay if if that comes up in the ?
117	t: uh-huh
302	c: okay alright so some kids find it helpful to write down their goals and other kids prefer to just talk about them
305	c: what would you ?
106	t: i don want to write down i don want to talk about them i just want to do them
311	c: you just want to do them okay so you don need to write it down
117	t: right
328	c: you've got it in your head so to summarize treadmill drinks
106	t: bench
329	c: oh i'm sorry
331	c: what'd you ?
106	t: the bench
328	c: the bench okay so treadmill weight bench
333	c: what else did we come up ?
106	t: drinking healthy eating healthy
328	c: drinking and having healthy foods in the refrigerator at home and in the refrigerator at your dad's
117	t: yes
333	c: anything ?
109	t: and well i kind of want to put like because i got a bed and it hurts my back a lot so i sleep on the top bunk a little bit because there's more cushioning
330	c: uh-huh
106	t: so i'm trying to get a new bed in my house
311	c: okay so you'd like to get a new bed to for your back
119	t: mm-hmm because when a lot of people think that bed don hurt my back because i got a bunk bed yeah like a futon so it goes and it kind of curves down and it comes up oh i see and i like sleeping in the middle of the bed right so i got to sleep on that part
312	c: it's kind of i see so that kind of messes with you
344	c: so what what do you see as the biggest barrier to making these things ? the treadmill the weight bench the healthy foods and the juices
109	t: the biggest ? to get my parents to kind of help me do it
326	c: get your parents to help you do it okay
109	t: because my dad he knows and he's he likes to work he works seven days a week okay and he comes home at one two o'clock in the morning won take a break mm-hmm and it's like we barely have time to spend together like we don go to the movies mm-hmm if i want to go to the movies i probably go with my brother and his girlfriend
307	c: so you're missing your dad missing the quality time not just the sitting at work time
109	t: yeah and with my mom
307	c: and your mom yeah
328	c: so what you want is you want them to help you and you've come out with some very specific things you want your dad to have some healthy foods in the house and consider going to the gym with you you want your mom to pick you up from your dad's so you don have to sit there all night and maybe you can do some healthy things at home although i'll have you also talk to her about it when we come back together
117	t: okay
331	c: okay anything else you want to bring up before i go get ?
117	t: no
308	c: okay alright well it sounds like this is something you i like your words you said i don want to talk about it i don want to write it down i want to do it you're ready you are ready right now to make a change
305	c: what are you going what change can you make when you go home today when you leave this ?
112	t: i can walk around the block a couple times okay talk to my dad about getting a truck to get the treadmill home
313	c: okay you're going to walk around the block talk to your dad about the truck to the treadmill
106	t: play a little basketball
313	c: and play some basketball
112	t: i'll have to do that inaudible
328	c: anyway because you've got to get your skills up to beat your friend laughs when he gets back yeah and you mentioned going shopping with your dad today to get some healthier choices too
117	t: oh yes
