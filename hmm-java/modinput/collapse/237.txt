345	c: how are things going ? what'd you ?
117	t: long
327	c: ? yeah it turned out to be a longer day
301	c: well hopefully we can you know get you going so that you can come here do you know do the things you came here to do if it's okay i just wanted to start by letting you know that this is the part of the session where the video camera is on both of them are on and eventually i just kind of forget they're there laughs so
306	c: do you have any questions about ?
117	t: no not at all
301	c: okay and also just so that you know in this kind of meeting anything that you say to me is private and confidential except if you were to tell me that you were going to hurt yourself or somebody else or if there was a child or elderly person in trouble that you told me about i would have to say something to the proper authorities
306	c: and if you know there are things that you and i talk about that you want to make sure that we talk about with your mom then i'll just make sure that i get your permission for that ?
117	t: not really any i don really just blank
301	c: no okay so from here you and i are going to meet for a few minutes and we'll talk a little bit about weight and whether you want to make any changes related to weight and then i'll meet with your mom for a little bit and then both of you together and that will be it
117	t: okay
305	c: ? so would it be okay if we started by just talking about what you think about your ?
106	t: there was a point when i was like i was with my father you know kind of it was stuff going on with him and you know how people can get stressed out and eating and stuff i used to do that a lot a lot but like for the past two to three months you know i haven been with him kinda left that out left it out but since then i been to the doctor found out you know i had to lose something i'm on a diet i've been doing good
330	c: okay
114	t: my weight just it just increased i don sneak nothing i don eat get any big big sized portions i don know what's going on
307	c: okay so you're a little confused it sounds like you're gonna
114	t: very confused
307	c: oh very confused
313	c: and you've got some ideas on you know things that you feel like there are some changes that you want to make and that you've actually it sounds like you've made a few i mean you're eating differently
114	t: fruits and got walking and everything but it don be doing nothing
305	c: mm-hmm yeah so well you know would it be okay if we just talked a little bit about what you think the things are that people do when they want to lose ?
106	t: they exercise cardio and all that stuff i actually have no choice but to do cardio 0:02:45 in gym so so it's not that
345	c: it's kind of forced ?
117	t: not really so it's not that
330	c: okay
116	t: i don eat a lot i don necessarily you know even though i have gym i just you know my parents still try to they don believe me doing that so they still try to do some at home i walk but that's pretty much it it's and i've been eating fruits and vegetables i'm not really eating that much so that's the only thing i do know that can help me with my weight but that's not working obviously
305	c: okay well you know what are you hoping to accomplish in our session ?
117	t: i don know to be honest with you
328	c: okay so some things as you mentioned before you know things are confusing and are making what sounds like some healthier eating choices fruits and vegetables i heard you say you don feel like you overeat you get exercise in gym some cardio and you do some walking
305	c: so i guess you know if you had to take a guess at you know if there was any one thing that maybe needed to be tweaked a little bit what would you say that might ?
112	t: i might say my sleep maybe
343	c: your ? tell me a little more about that if you would
109	t: i don really know the name i got sleep apnea i think they call it
312	c: yeah sleep apnea
109	t: yeah i don know why it's because i can rarely sleep from the morning time to the night time and just be asleep i can be literally asleep for the whole day and the next day at school i still wake up tired i don know why it's crazy and like normally i don know if this is i don know if that's part of it but once i get done i get sleepy you know and like what i start to do i literally wait until a certain time to go to sleep and it be it be around like time to go to sleep or whatever it don be early
312	c: is it in your sleep ?
109	t: yeah but but i guess just the food is still in my stomach or whatever and i guess that's keeping my weight up because that's the only thing i can really say is doing that i don know what else
312	c: so i guess what i hear you saying is there is a certain part of the day when because of your sleep apnea and maybe some other factors but you're not sure that you have a sleepier time and you're wondering if maybe that's not giving your food a chance to digest
117	t: i guess yes
305	c: okay well you know how interested are you in working out maybe a plan to change that for ?
112	t: i'm very interested in it
311	c: okay so it sounds like you're kind of ready like i don need to convince you laughs
117	t: yeah
305	c: okay alrighty so i guess you know if you were going to walk out of here today with something in mind that you will change for this part of the day what do you think would give you the most benefit if you were to ?
112	t: just to live a long life because somebody literally younger than me died 'cause of their weight
307	c: wow yeah
112	t: and so and he was only 15 so
311	c: so you have some motivators that are you know kind of health and kind of down the road things could happen
112	t: yeah i would have to have me die from anything
326	c: mm-hmm so you know you mentioned this part of the afternoon when or the evening when it's kind of difficult for you to be active during that time
305	c: if we were maybe to think about something that you might like to do whether it's at this part of the day or a different part of the day
302	c: a lot of people do the things that you mentioned they change what they eat or how they eat they change their activity level in some way to help with weight loss
305	c: so if you were gonna make a change which one of those would you think would be the most beneficial to you right ?
120	t: like as ?
301	c: well if you and i were to think of like say an exercise plan or like maybe a plan to i don know how much tv you watch but maybe a plan to watch less tv some people that i've met with like to make a plan to change the type of food they eat or the way that it's cooked for example or they like to keep track of what they eat so that they really have a good sense of you know whether when they say i don think i overeat that they actually know
117	t: okay
305	c: so do any of those ideas sound appealing to you ?
112	t: i guess the less tv and i barely even do that i know it's not the food 'cause like because of me we're all doing it so i just help everybody else too out at the same time so it's not
309	c: yeah that's a good idea
117	t: that
302	c: okay if you'd like me to i have a couple of sheets in here that i can show you that might be helpful to keep track
311	c: like you said that you were thinking about maybe less tv
302	c: so i think it's this bottom sheet yep so here's something that might be helpful this is called a physical activity log and it does more than track your physical activity you can use it to track how much tv you watch so for example let's see today is tuesday for example if you were to circle one tv for every 30 minutes that you watch today then maybe you could make a goal for yourself to do something a little different the next day
305	c: and how many calories they think they burned by doing it so what do you think of that ?
112	t: it sounds like a good idea the thing is though we don even i don well i don have cable really in my room so i don watch there ain nothing to watch on tv so i don watch it the only time i the only time i ever do that is like if i'm sleeping and just need something on that's that's the only time i ever do other than that the only thing i do in my room is just sit in my room and listen to music and that's it and that's that's the only thing i do
325	c: okay so it actually i mean from what you're saying it actually sounds like if we you know were to come up with a plan for cutting out some tv time that really that wouldn make a huge difference 'cause if i'm understanding you correctly
106	t: i don watch it
325	c: you don watch much of it
302	c: okay so would it be worth maybe looking at a couple other of these handouts and see if anything appeals to ?
306	c: okay some of them are just lists of places to go for things and we can take a look at those in a moment but here's another handout that i have that some people like to use as a way to come up with a plan for changes that they want to make so this sheet right here just describes for you if you were going to do a workout for weight loss that this is how often it's recommended that you do it and for how long that high intensity do you have a good sense of what high low and medium intensity ? ?
302	c: so maybe picture like if you were just strolling down the street not really trying to walk fast that would be mild or easy intensity if you were kind of walking the way you do when you have to go to class not that you're late for class but just you have to get to your next class and you don want to be late that would probably be moderate or medium activity and if you were really late and you were just booking it like as fast as you could that would be high intensity workout to where you get to the point where you can probably feel your chest pounding so okay and then let's see these are some food ones yeah the rest of these are foods let's see your choices that i have in here are i don know if this is appealing to you or if this would work for you and your family but there's these some of these might be a little young for you although there's boys and girls club for older people here's ymca and healthy living detroit these are just some places that sometimes people go to work out if they you know are in a position where they can get to these places and you know 0:11:47 the membership fee which is pretty low compared to like if you were to join a fitness club it would be very very high but these are more affordable
305	c: do any of these ideas appeal to ?
112	t: yeah it would help me
305	c: mm-hmm well from here and i don think i mentioned this earlier but the point of us meeting together is not for me to tell you what to do 'cause you've probably had that experience before where people just kind of boss you around and
301	c: say what comes next so really this is your show you know if there are some ideas that you're interested in working on or a plan that you're interested in coming up with so that you can walk away today with something written down or in your head that says okay today this is what i'm doing tomorrow this is what i'm doing i can help with that but like i said i don want to be the one that tells you what to do laughs and we haven talked about food much either if that's maybe a different path to go down
106	t: well when it comes to food wise like like i said everybody you know we're all eating healthy we all you know eat what's good or whatever we're all doing it because my stepfather he's a diabetic so he also got a work on that too for himself you know everybody trying to stay healthy too so kind of like so it's helping me but you know at the same time they're helping everybody else so it's not i don go out i don sneak no candy or junk food or nothing like that i don i don do that you know i probably have like one i probably have one a day i probably eat something you know that's probably you know a little fattening but that's only that one day not in a row or nothing that's only one day but other than that if it's not healthy or good for my body i really don eat it at all
301	c: okay well so maybe you maybe you i'm offering you some options that really just aren what you're looking for or what you think would be useful and would maybe another option be just to you know have a plan in place for how to get information about what to do ? you know what i mean like make a list of like who would you call or if you need to go to your doctor and ask what they would recommend go to the library you know or on the internet and do some research to find out you know what would be a good plan for you know like a workout routine or you know just like we talked about you know other ways of cooking that might be even more healthy than what you're doing now
305	c: would that be kind of more what you're looking ?
112	t: yeah it would
345	c: what'd you ?
112	t: it would be
301	c: okay alright well if you would like i have a plan that we can take a look at that is just a blank plan and maybe we can think about you know what you might want to do sometimes it helps people to get an idea of what they want to work on just by kind of seeing how it might be written out so this is an idea of if you wanted to make a change like you mentioned earlier that you're kind of ready to do something you just don know what yet once we figure out what your plan might be then you write down a motivating statement like why you would want to follow that plan and then we plan for things that could stop you from being successful like barriers things that could get in your way of actually following through on the plan and then solutions and then like i mentioned a couple times earlier just kind of a an idea for okay what's the first step to ? and then some social support something someone could do to help you out
117	t: mm-hmm
305	c: so would this be interesting for you to talk ?
112	t: yeah i guess it would help
305	c: okay so some people write it down and some people just talk about what they might like to do what would work best for ?
112	t: probably just talk about it
330	c: okay
106	t: my plan is to i don want to necessarily i don want to just lose all this but i do want it to be at a point where it can be like not death defying not a death defying level but so i guess that's my plan i want to do this because it's so many people that i've lost in my family because of this and so i really want to live a long life my family wants me to the thing that might get in my way really the point i'm at the point where there's not really something that could get in my way back then there probably was you know 'cause i was young but like i'm really at the point where i'm really committed to this so i don really necessarily think that there will be something getting in my way if i see something if i see some if i see something then it'll get 0:17:07 i'm not going to eat it i'm not going to touch it or nothing like that i'm just going to
313	c: so you're at the you're at i guess what i'm hearing you say is you're at the point where once you know what you're going to do nothing's going to stop you
106	t: i'm sticking to this
308	c: okay great that sounds like it fits right with your motivation
106	t: the thing to reach my goal i guess i guess i got to work on my cardio 'cause it's not the food that i eat i do know that i guess that's the only thing the cardio really i do do it in gym but that's only only like an hour in gym
333	c: okay so are you saying that like the first step to take is to start doing some cardio outside of ?
106	t: i i do be walking a lot i do walk a lot but my but my whole years i walk i can walk any i can walk around the road and not be tired because i'm just so used to it the doctor said you can walk as much as you want but if you you have to sweat to kind of work it out if you don do that then the walking is pointless so i guess i'm going to have to do that like riding bikes like riding a bike and stuff i can i can ride a bike anywhere i want that that'd be nice but it's going to take me a minute for me to start working out 0:18:29 a couple hours
313	c: sure yeah it sounds like you've got some stamina already but that you can kind of foresee that at some point you might reach your limit and need to work a little
106	t: yeah i may be big i may be big i'm not just totally lazy i just big i do work out and everything but my when he explained workout to me i was talking about benchpressing 0:18:51 and whatever that's kind of what i would do i did anyway and he said that's not good because you know muscle weigh more than fat so that's so they tried to cut that out but i'm that's just what i like to do to relieve stuff off my mind it's like one of the things i do
310	c: well i mean nobody says that you can do it at all but maybe you know the idea is kind of what you've mentioned is add in some cardio too
308	c: you know and of course you know follow your doctor's instructions laughs but you know but but nobody's saying that you know it's a bad thing to do things that you enjoy though you have lots and lots of good ideas about other cardio things you could add in
117	t: that's pretty much it
331	c: okay what about that last ? is there somebody that you can kind of picture helping you in some way even if it's just kind of giving you the pat on the shoulder and saying hey you did a good job today i saw you out ?
112	t: i'll say my stepfather yeah he supports me a lot with this
328	c: alright so now you have this this plan that you are going to get yourself into good health you know you feel like you know you don have to be like a stick or anything but you know you want to make some changes that will be long lasting with good health benefits for you and you feel like you've got motivation because there are some people in your family who you know who have had some problems and you don want to have that happen to you and so let me see so you didn feel like anything was really going to get in your way and the first step that you could take was if i remember correctly you're going to think about you know how you might add in some cardio
331	c: okay and then you feel like your step dad could really help you out what would he do to help you ?
112	t: he he cooks and so what he'll do is like like he won cook nothing just for me that's healthy and then he'll eat something he will literally cook something for everyone that's healthy he'll be on me about you know getting fruit eating fruit what'd you eat today that type of stuff like that so he helps me a lot he encourages me to do this because because he because he actually found out that the kid died at the age of 15 overweight and it shook him up he didn want the same thing to happen to me so it's like kind of really encouraged him to go for long and basically encouraged me to stick with this and make sure nothing gets in my way with this so
308	c: well so you have lots of good ideas and it sounds like you're really motivated to go out there and get some of them done so that you know you can reach your goal
301	c: and the things that we've talked about today are just kind of a first step just some ideas to kind of get you an you know an organized plan that you can follow and sometime down the road you might want to change it and that's fine
305	c: it's your plan you know
301	c: laughs and that's what happens with people as you probably know you know you get really good at doing something and you feel like it's time to move on to the next thing so that would be a time when you you know decide whether or not you want to make a new plan
117	t: okay
345	c: okay what questions can i answer for ?
117	t: not really really i don really have any questions at the moment
331	c: okay so on a scale of one to ten with one being not ready at all and ten being the most ready you've ever been how ready do you feel like you are to go out tonight and get ?
106	t: i'd say eight
313	c: about an ? okay
112	t: yeah eight 'cause i really i just know i just had a doctor's appointment i didn know i was going to be doing all this
327	c: oh yeah you had a long day
117	t: yeah
309	c: yeah so but you still i mean an eight is pretty high
117	t: yeah
331	c: how come you didn say like six or ?
112	t: because i'm ready every day and i guess i'm being i guess you know people is helping me out with this but i guess you know i just need that little extra shove or whatever kind of because they help me but they don really know like they know a lot about it but i guess i just need like people that literally go to school for this and stuff to help me with this because i'm i'm totally confused by the whole subject of why i'm still gaining weight
331	c: mm-hmm who do you think you could ask if you wanted more ?
112	t: laughs i'm hoping y'all and so that's pretty much it really
301	c: okay well so hopefully you know we got you pointed in the right direction as far as you know there are some ideas that you have and it might be a matter of just implementing them
302	c: you know but there might also be some other people that you might want to you know 0:23:32 to ask and you know if there were some good resources out there
331	c: can you think of people who might have given you good information ?
112	t: my mother she's one she showed me some things about it and everything so yeah
311	c: okay alrighty so that sounds like she's kind of your go-to person if you really need some information alrighty
301	c: well unless you have any other questions what i'll do from here is i'll bring you out in the other room and i'll meet with your mom for a little bit and i think our research assistants have something to do with you as well to kind of keep you busy laughs and then in probably about 20 minutes we'll bring you back in here and finish up together how do you think you if you want to how do you think you might want to share the plan that you came up with for your ? you can do a couple different things i mean when we come together you can talk with her about what you'd like to do and what your goals are you can choose not to share it with her you know if you would like me to talk with her about it at first i can do that too
119	t: yeah one we do sit down and talk about this all the time so it's not really nothing that i'm going to tell her that she already haven already haven heard from me so it's not so it's not really you know like i already tell her 'cause we always talk about it and everything so it's not really nothing new to her
305	c: okay so what would be your preference for how to let her know that you know this is what you'd like to do and begin either tomorrow or ?
112	t: i guess just tell her just like yeah this is what i'm going to do that's it
301	c: okay laughs so when you when the three of us come together then if it's okay i'll give you a chance to say you know what we talked about and you can say as much as you want to or as little as you want to ? alrighty i'm going to stick this back in here for now and i will take you in the other room
