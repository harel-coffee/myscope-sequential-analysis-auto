305	c: well i thought i'd double check because i definitely want didn want to have you doing something that you didn want to do
343	c: you don want to do ? because that really isn helpful for people a lot of times so how do you feel about your ?
112	t: i wouldn mind losing a couple pounds you know inaudible it's like my stomach or you know i got a problem with my stomach inaudible like couple off my arms little bit off my thighs just see what that's it you know i just definitely want to lose my stomach you know
311	c: so you're looking to lose some weight and it has a lot to do kind of with your appearance and and maybe fitting into clothes you were mentioning like with your stomach and some stuff with the size of your thighs
117	t: yeah yeah
307	c: about what they say about peoples' weight you've had some not really great experience with that
112	t: hmm yeah but i'm going to say i don like people judging you know
311	c: so you prefer to just kind of let them you know they'll leave you alone you don want them to say anything
112	t: well people don say stuff it's just for my benefit that i want to you know i mean i look at some of these people i mean people walking outside it's like you know i'm not going to get that size i either want to stay the size i am or go down and not up you know i see people standing out here i'm like no i can get that big it's just like wow inaudible
311	c: you're noticing other people
112	t: yeah you know and hear people talking about inaudible
311	c: so people aren necessarily saying anything to you
112	t: inaudible probably ignore the people diabetes or something
311	c: so they are saying that and they also have some health problems
112	t: no like my daddy he had diabetes my grandma had diabetes on his side and you know he said it probably would pass down and he got high blood pressure something like that right now but other than that
311	c: so you've got some stuff in your family
112	t: to do with it
313	c: so thinking about losing weight is something that you have been doing
106	t: well no not really i'll probably just eat on some fruit and drink some juice or something like drink hi-c or bottled water skim milk i can drink the red top milk because you know i only drink 2% and fat free because i know inaudible
310	c: so you're already suggesting some eating changes
103	t: plus inaudible i love eating like grilled cheese sandwich you know inaudible stuff like that i really don i'm like not a picky eater sometimes like i want certain things inaudible like sometimes like i just eat random stuff just go back in my room and get tv
314	c: so you don always pay attention to what you're eating
117	t: yeah
325	c: i mean you don you're not like you said you're not picky so you eat a lot of different types of foods
106	t: yeah like okay well i'm somewhat picky like if i get something i just like i don eat chips really like i'll give my stuff away like oh you can have mine or if i have some candy like swedish fish i get about five of them give the bag to someone else stuff like that
313	c: so already you're kind of lowering your the amount of food or your portions that you're having of different foods
106	t: yeah like i don eat breakfast in the morning when i go to summer college you know i just get up and go out the door and then we get out like at 11:45 so we don get nothing at school so inaudible been hanging until like two-something but inaudible without eating or drinking nothing
313	c: mm-hmm so eating in the beginning of the day isn something that you're usually doing
117	t: no
302	c: i have some information about breakfast and kind of meals throughout the day would you want to hear about ?
306	c: well it's actually i don know if you you might have heard that breakfast is you know one of the most important meals of the day and it can really help your body start the day off well in terms of you know giving it the energy it needs and not waiting too long to eat so that you get extra hungry and overeat when you wait later in the day what do you think of that information for ?
106	t: i mean if if i i mean i wouldn say like if i you know if i just go at 11:45 go there at 8:30 to 11:45 then i'd probably go and like get something but you know i wouldn wait to do something like i'd probably eat a little something then just go out finish playing or doing something but i would not say i eat too much i don eat too much i probably just eat little bits of something and just go about my business you know like if we go out to a restaurant i might get chicken drum two chicken drum a roll and some carrots or something and some juice and that's it inaudible it's like the more i eat i guess you know my stomach get used to it you know and like if i'm full i wouldn eat no more like some of my relatives they just keep eating and eating and eating you know until they get full and like even though they're full my little brother he's little he's not fat he's little he's so short he just eat and eat he don do nothing nothing happens to him just like my auntie her name is gloria she'll have two plates she's burning everything she just eat but she's not inaudible but she thick you know she's just eating
307	c: so it's kind of frustrating to see other people in the family eat a lot and then not have to worry about their weight
117	t: yeah sometimes
313	c: and it's also something that you kind of can feel when you're full
106	t: i feel when i'm full and i stop because you know some people you know with their stomach and inaudible
308	c: so you actually unlike a lot of people can feel what it's like and then know how to when to stop yourself
117	t: yeah
305	c: and as far as in the morning you know it sounds like eating something before you went really wouldn work for you but then you do have a snack
106	t: like i mean sometimes i eat like a plain bagel and the kraft's the cream cheese inaudible
313	c: so sometimes you do have some stuff in the morning
106	t: and a juice box inaudible won eat the whole thing
313	c: so you're watching your portions
106	t: yeah i just get at least something i won eat it all like i want a taste i want something inaudible like you know i'm just just pick over food you know inaudible
314	c: okay so you kind of have little bits of things and it's not that when you say you're done you mean more i'm done with this food and you kind of go looking for other things to eat
114	t: yeah or i probably just you know focus on water tv juice i really drink like hi-c or hawaiian punch like water i like gatorade powerade stuff like that but they say they have more calories from sugar so
313	c: so you're paying attention to what's in the what the stuff you're drinking already
106	t: yeah sometimes like i don eat chocolate at all anything with chocolate in it make me really thirsty so i don start eating chocolate
328	c: so you've made some some adjustments to to your eating in order to lose weight so we've been spending a lot of time talking about the you know nutrition and the food stuff side of losing ?
301	c: and we can most definitely in the time that we have left kind of keep talking about that part of it or we can talk more about activity you know exercising and things like that in order to lose weight
305	c: which would you rather talk ?
112	t: it doesn matter it doesn matter you know inaudible we can talk about the activity
311	c: so you're more interested in perhaps kind of leaving here making a change in the amount of exercise you're doing activity versus the food stuff
117	t: yeah no i don know
325	c: you're not really sure
305	c: i mean this really is kind of your show we can talk about what you like to talk about and
120	t: okay i was just saying like what they was going to do next inaudible have you fill out the binder things
301	c: so that part of it was a little bit more structured where they said here this is what you have to do this is what you have to do
112	t: i guess you know the activity talk about the activity
117	t: mm-hmm
305	c: or you could definitely kind of just talk to me about what kinds of stuff you're doing during the day or that you're thinking about doing in order to lose weight
106	t: i'll just look at the paper
305	c: alright so this handout here and you know anytime you can just say "hey katie this is really boring i don want to you know we don have to look at this anymore"
302	c: but it really talks about how to have a goal of 60 minutes every day of activity and mixing in aerobic activity with strength and stretching
106	t: i've been i've been walking like if i go to my cousin house we always end up walking to a friend's house stuff like that i be walking up and down the stairs my mom calls me up and down the stairs stuff like that
313	c: so you have some time you know that you will go for walks and then you're doing some movement around the house
106	t: yeah i'm pretty sure i walk about 20 minutes every time i be walking with my cousin
313	c: all right so you could get you'll get a solid you know 20 minutes in and how many days a week
333	c: and how many days a week
323	c: since we're kind of looking here i noticed that you're kind of looking at this you know 20 minutes as the the guide here for that
106	t: i been play dancing with my cousin inaudible
313	c: alright so you're getting some aerobic activity in there
308	c: that's great into your week
114	t: i'm just like sometimes i be playful playing around you know i just play sometimes i'm not really good just sit down with people
325	c: so your day you know you're active sometimes and not always
302	c: but you do have some opportunity to do things like walking ?
308	c: another thing that this this mentions is the idea of screen time in terms of you know watching tv or playing video games or being on the computer to do that about two hours or or less every day and that's just because the more time that people are sitting down it's just less time that they're probably moving around
116	t: hmm well i look at tv like today i looked at the tv or you know i changed the movie channel inaudible play with my cousins all that then i took a shower i i don know i take care of my hygiene good and stuff like that
308	c: so you take good care of yourself
314	c: and throughout the day you are watching tv so you have lots of different stuff going on during the day it almost sounds like you don really have a regular schedule
115	t: nope whatever happens i guess is my schedule
325	c: pretty easy going go with the flow
112	t: i like to have fun like go out to places i like to just go with my friends
311	c: so making activities fun throughout your day is pretty it's something that kind of fits with your personality and what you like to do
117	t: mm-hmm
302	c: well when i meet with people a lot of times they kind of come up with an idea of what they might like to work with or work on when they leave here in terms of either making a change in their eating or you know a change in how much exercise they're getting and sometimes they just like to kind of think about different things that they could do
306	c: what do you think about doing something like ?
116	t: hmm i really can say because throughout my whole every day i either end up running running around or you know i would think about not eating fried chicken i'm so tired of chicken i don even want to see chicken yeah
313	c: so you would really think about cutting out or cutting down on the amount of fried chicken that you're eating
119	t: yeah that's right i'm going to eat chicken wings gonna have her friend come over and cook chicken and things like that you know i eat one piece i might put the other one back or like you know she cooking chicken and like i got so tired of it one day i guess like every food i eat i look like "is this ? "this is done" i'm like "i ain eating this she's like well don eat it then i said alright
312	c: so you have a lot of fried chicken throughout the week in your house
301	c: so making a change from from either having less like only one piece
313	c: so the grilled chicken salad you're a fan of
112	t: yeah i love salads and like there are all different kinds you know pasta salad and stuff like that
115	t: mm-hmm like today i don know what i'm going to do all today me and my cousin we shared a slice of apple pie and i just inaudible have to get ready to come here i don know where we're going today
325	c: so you don know what's coming as far as food later on
117	t: yeah no
305	c: well if you were going to say you know either cut down on the amount of the fried chicken you're having or not have it why why would you want to do something like ? what would be the most important reason to do ?
311	c: so you you saw that and really kind of saw the the negative stuff that can happen if you eat too many of the fried foods and too much of the fast food
106	t: mcdonald's is not really that good like only thing i get from mcdonald's is their sweet tea and their bacon ranch salad their their salad is basically inaudible
313	c: so you already are making healthy choices when you're going to fast food
106	t: i barely go to i don go to taco bell no more taco bell i think taco bell is just inaudible you know
305	c: it's not your thing
119	t: yeah like i was sitting in the driveway they had a bag with meat and they just all they do is cut it open you know just put it on you know i see why it's good you know because they really don make it someone else make it put it in the bag just throw it in there
305	c: but it's not the way that you like to eat food
119	t: i want-no
328	c: so you really have kind of said that you know it sounds like the fried foods and some of the the choices that you're making when you go to fast food is is really because you just don like what can happen to your body if you have too much of it
112	t: like mongolian barbecue i would say is the most goodest place because you know they make their own food they have raw meat you know vegetables and fruit salad
311	c: okay so they kind of cook it right in front of you
112	t: have you been to ? it's nice you get your own seasoning you know you don have to worry about someone you know you don know what they're doing to your food but they're bringing it out to you smelling good inaudible
311	c: so you really like that idea of making your own stuff and
106	t: like i eat shrimp and chicken shrimp and chicken or just chicken and scallops or i i didn know but i ate a piece of calamari or something like that inaudible you know the i thought it was something else i'm like here like that's good
313	c: they got you trying new stuff too yeah
115	t: yeah like tofu people say it's good to eat tofu but i'm not sure i'm going to eat tofu
325	c: you don really know if you want to try that one
328	c: okay so you have lots of ideas in terms of places to go that you can get fresher food as opposed to going with more of the fast food and you have some thoughts about cutting down on the fried foods like fried chicken at home what are some things
112	t: baked chicken i love baked chicken that's good
310	c: okay so really subbing out the fried and putting in baked and really cutting down on all those calories from the oil
117	t: yes
344	c: mm-hmm well what are some things that could get in the way of cutting down on the fried ?
119	t: like inaudible at the house at home
344	c: what could happen at home ?
114	t: what could get in the ? well nothing can get in the way of me doing what i need to do that i want i really couldn answer that you know i would say for other people you know they say people like you know like a parent she wants to make chicken fried chicken and your cousin there inaudible you're thinking about getting some baked chicken but you know you'd probably be more like you know how some people saying "why are you eating this and ? you on a diet or ? you know some people inaudible you know just some people do that because it's what other people do
305	c: but that's not you
115	t: i don take it for anybody you know what i'm saying like if someone asks me a question like what inaudible or it's to you you know sometimes i get angry and stuff like what do you want to eat you ? like do you want to go here or ? like it really doesn matter it's up to you no no it's up to you and i don really care where we ? inaudible that's that's all i have to say
313	c: alright so nothing's going to get in your way in terms of you know if you're cutting back on some of the fried foods
117	t: yeah
305	c: well what's the first thing that you can do in order to get to that goal of not having the fried ?
106	t: not allow it to be cooked for me or so no no probably go find something else in the refrigerator
313	c: alright so number one would be to have something else be made and number two to have the you know go find something else yourself
331	c: alright so you've got some ideas on that with you know what about what's something that your mom can do to help you reach your goal of not having ?
112	t: laughs not cook it
330	c: alright so
115	t: tell her like you know let's have something else you know she asks me what do i want i said i don know you know you know cook something i don know
325	c: so she's asking you what you would like to have to eat and but if you're not really sure and don give her any ideas she kind of
115	t: and like sometimes i'm not i wasn really hungry to eat it's like seems like i don know oh no you know it don make a difference to me so i don know
304	c: so there's this balance between you're not quite being hungry and also not really you know having a taste for anything yeah you don really care and then also the fact that she's defaulting back to a fried food which is something you're staying away from
114	t: yeah but she wasn eating fried chicken like that but you know like right now we don have nothing in our refrigerator it's like the same thing with my auntie when you open it there's nothing in there you're like go grocery shopping or something that's probably really like why my cousins we don care to eat not just her but my other cousins you know they really don care to eat nothing but we'll probably just go about our business forget about the food and stuff like that inaudible
312	c: there aren a lot of options around
117	t: yeah
311	c: but one thing that your mom could do would be to not cook as much of the fried
112	t: yeah like it's she'll she cook like she'll just cook like a lot of steamed vegetables vegetables stuff like that my grandma she stays with me you know she she bake a lot like she bake anything you know like ribs stuff like that chicken wings turkey and stuff like that
311	c: alright so members of your family are baking instead of frying so there are some ways
112	t: she likes to boil stuff stuff like that
301	c: alright well we're kind of getting to the point where we'll probably if it's okay with you switch places with your mom
112	t: and like eating like more salads or something you know baked chicken i love chicken but like if it's baked it's really good i like baked stuff or you know like i mean i eat steak but as long as it's cooked right on the skillet stuff like that
117	t: yeah inaudible
