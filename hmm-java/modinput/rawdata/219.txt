117 t: okay
306 c: what do you think about that ?
112 t: yeah i can think about that too
310 c: you can think about like kind of take a week of weight you know like weigh yourself everi day but look at the whole week instead of just like
307 c: oh god look at what happen today you know
302 c: okay i just want to make sure becaus sometim you know kid can get discourag but but the weigh yourself it sound like that was pretti like motiv like wow i realli need to do this the other thing is that we recommend weigh yourself when you first get up with the same cloth so same time of day same cloth on becaus that can also affect your weight
117 t: okay okay
305 c: okay i don't know if you want to add that or if you just know it it up to you okay and the first step you can take when you leav here today
106 t: just like to weigh myself right when i'm done eat or someth i can weigh myself
304 c: okay so weigh yourself when you'r done eat is one idea but of cours the you know as we talk about the problem is is your weight can go up like right after you eat
305 c: what els could you mayb do when you leav here today ?
106 t: cut down on some fast food restaur
349 c: okay so if you is there a chanc you'd go to a fast food on your way out of here ?
109 t: probabl
311 c: okay so we we talk about like order stuff from the fast food restaur
302 c: i think there hand out around here around fast food choic i'll leav all these with you</text>
305 c: <cat>302</cat>
117 t: mm-hmm
313 c: so it sound like one one step you want to take when you leav here today is when if you do go to a fast food which is someth you'd normal do is you'r go to make a differ choic
305 c: okay so if you want if that what you want you can write that down it sound like that that where you'r talk about make the biggest chang
302 c: now some kid find that when they start to make these chang they'r hungri becaus you'r you'r not eat as much
305 c: what are your thought about how you'r go to manag hunger ?
302 c: so if you go to the fast food restaur and you eat a salad and then you know two hour later you'r hungrier than you normal are
117 t: i i realli don't know
315 c: you'r not so sure how that how; you'r go to handl that
302 c: okay you want some idea ? i mean you said you want to eat more fruit and veget so one possibl is to have some healthier snack you know when you'r hungri like fruit or some other thing might be like pretzel or you know instead of chip or someth like that
306 c: what do you think of you know feel when you feel that hunger go toward the fruit ? would that work for you or kind of unrealist ?
111 t: a littl
326 c: a littl you'r not so sure realli whether that go to work becaus you know when you'r hungri you'r go to want some of these other food
302 c: okay well let think of what els might be anoth possibl is to have anoth small meal you know is to just have anoth like small you know chicken or grill chicken or you know someth that a littl more substanti than just a piec of fruit that realli will fill you up
117 t: okay
306 c: would that work better than just the fruit ?
111 t: probabl
310 c: probabl okay so to think about that then don't you know to not be afraid to have a coupl of small healthi meal instead of sort of one big whopper and fri you know kind of thing
117 t: okay
306 c: but and to pay attent the other thing to know is that hunger will go away eventu when you start adjust to a new way of eat so what do you think about some of those idea ?
112 t: i can work on it
326 c: okay just just know you know that that is a real it sound like that that a worri point for you i mean not a worri point but that a temptat point that when you get hungri that you might do thing so you'r come up with anoth idea so if hunger get in the way
333 c: you'r go to tri what ?
106 t: have like go eat the fruit and stuff
313 c: eat a fruit or anoth small healthi meal
117 t: okay
302 c: mm-hmm versus like a bag of chip or a snack some peopl think like oh okay i alreadi had lunch so i'm just go to have a snack well guess what ? sometim those snack are wors than laugh anoth salad or anoth meal i'm just look here other idea are like low fat chees you know again just even eat a coupl of piec of turkey breast you know like lunch meat you know but healthi lunch meat like turkey breast those kind of thing
301 c: let talk about i'm go to bring your mom in for a minut you know after i meet with you
112 t: she can help me by not go to buy fast food and stuff like that and bring more fruit and veget in the hous
323 c: okay so whi don't you put that down ? right here what someth my-you could say mom if that is your mom out there
328 c: okay so just to summar you you'v thought about this alreadi i mean this is none of this is new this is someth you'v want to do for a long time and you'v alreadi made some reall;i great chang i mean walk everi day is a huge thing and you'r commit to it when you set your mind to someth you do it
307 c: and now you'r set your mind to a new thing which is you realli want to start look at how you'r eat and you'r go to specif eat more fruit and veget and when you go to fast food tri to order a salad and that you know that way you'r not make like huge chang in everi area of your life laugh which is a littl overwhelm you'r talk about realli two specif thing so i hope that seem a littl more manag than just sort of like oh all this stuff i mean you know well three thing one you'r alreadi do and two you'r go to add and if you get in the if hunger get in the way which you are you know realist that you might you'r go to then instead of go toward junki food you'r go to tri to just have anoth small meal or fruit and veget and you also came up with a great idea to motiv yourself which is you'r go to start weigh yourself everi morn so that you can rememb okay this is what i'm focus on becaus when you rememb you do it
117 t: yeah
305 c: it just more when you don't think about it you just sort of go through your life everi day so did i get that right ?
117 t: yeah
345 c: okay anyth els that you want to bring up ?
