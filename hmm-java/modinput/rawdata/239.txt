313 c: you said that you'v been tri to lose weight
346 c: and could you tell me whi you'v been tri to ?
112 t: becaus i don't want to be overweight to the point i can't fit into ani cloth or anyth and that about it
311 c: okay so one of your concern is that you don't want to find yourself in a posit where you can't fit the cloth that you know
112 t: you can't do noth like walk or anyth
310 c: okay so you see that be overweight might be someth that could limit a person in what they can do and how they can move around or cloth they can wear yeah and i know it import to be in a posit where you can do those thing you know be activ and wear cloth that you like and that kind of thing okay
348 c: how long have you been tri to lose weight ?
112 t: ever sinc i got diagnos with lupus
348 c: okay and how long ago was that
305 c: if you don't mind me ask ?
119 t: i think it was on octob in 09
348 c: this past octob ?
119 t: yeah oh not this year in 2010 2009
313 c: okay so a littl bit over a year you'v been work on it
331 c: how success do you think that you'v been ?
117 t: it been okay
346 c: yeah ? do you feel like you have lost weight or ?
110 t: i feel like i have but on the scale i go on the scale and it show the same thing or higher
332 c: oh right okay alright and so how do you explain that i mean what do you think is happen where you feel like you lost weight but the scale say you didn't ?
120 t: what do you mean ?
332 c: what do you think happen that make it so that you feel like you lost weight like what inform do you have that tell you you lost weight when the scale say you didn't ?
119 t: like the way my pant feel on me like if they'r tight or not tight
311 c: oh okay alright and that a good way to judg you know whether or not you'v been success is that your cloth will fit differ
117 t: yeah
307 c: so that must be confus for you to get on the scale and find out that it no chang huh ?
303 c: has your doctor given you inform about that ?
120 t: what ?
330 c: about 5:01 yep
112 t: yeah he told me that i had to limit what i eat and stuff 5:09
328 c: okay okay so i mean i guess at this point you and i have talk about a number of thing and what i'v learn from you is that you do want to lose some weight and it sound like you'r tell me it part for health reason but also part becaus you want to fit into cloth and make sure you still fit into them and that you have some other reason relat to be abl to be physic activ and walk around and do other thing but that so far you'v made some chang in what you eat but that you haven't realli seen a differ on the scale even though your pant fit differ
117 t: mm-hmm
305 c: okay well so what do you want to do about that ?
112 t: tri to exercis and do more activ
313 c: okay and so one thing that you'v tri alreadi is chang the way you eat
311 c: but you'r also mention that chang your activ level may be help too okay
348 c: do you have ani idea about what you might do specif ?
112 t: i'd go to the gym
333 c: okay and what would you do at the gym ?
112 t: probabl get on the treadmil and the thing where you do like that and you go lift the bar up 6:28
348 c: is it like a weight thing where you like you pull the bar down
112 t: i think it call weightlift it 6:33
313 c: okay oh alright so you can realli pictur yourself do some thing like get on the treadmil and use some of the other machin
106 t: and box and box
313 c: and box
330 c: wow that will take some energi huh ?
348 c: have you done that befor ?
112 t: no that what i want to do though box
330 c: okay laugh that sound like an interest activ certain someth that could keep you busi laugh
332 c: so when is you know what is at this point what stop you from do those thing ?
110 t: my weight issu and my health problem
312 c: okay so you see yourself be abl to do some stuff at the gym but right now you feel like you can't
306 c: is that correct ?
117 t: yeah
328 c: and it becaus you feel like you have to weigh less to start some of these activ and you have some other health issu like you mention be diagnos with lupus and is that someth that prevent you
110 t: yeah and i have high blood pressur so
307 c: okay okay well that must feel like you know a puzzl like what do you do next ?
305 c: okay well so you know if you had to think about where you might start what do you think the first thing you might be abl to do is ?
120 t: what do you mean by that ?
360 c: say that again ?
120 t: what do you mean by that ?
305 c: if you want to think about you know if you want to get to a point where you can do someth like box what do you think you know the first step you could take would be ?
106 t: mayb start by take it slow like walk and exercis start off easi and then build your way up
313 c: yeah so you can pictur yourself build up to someth later on down the road
308 c: that a realli great way of look at it too is
302 c: i think you know one of the thing i'v learn anyway is that peopl sometim feel that they have a big challeng and that they want to be at the level of do the box right away
313 c: and you see that mayb that someth to work up to start small and build up to that gradual okay
331 c: so you know i guess at this point a question i have to ask you is how confid do you feel that you can do those thing that you can get start ?
112 t: i feel comfort
346 c: you feel comfort with it ?
331 c: so how import is it to you ?
112 t: it import
331 c: yeah so if i ask you like on a scale of one to ten with one be not at all import and ten be the most import thing in your life right this moment where would you put
112 t: probabl about an eight or a seven
309 c: okay so that pretti high up there isn't it ?
331 c: yeah so whi would you say a seven or eight and not like a five or a six ?
112 t: caus it more import that you'r healthi than overweight and you have more health problem than you alreadi do
311 c: okay so you realli see this as an import thing with help you with your health and overal i can sens i mean that that an import goal is to have better health
302 c: okay alright so well you know some peopl find that it realli help to come up with a plan for what they would like to do and you'v start to talk about a plan alreadi like "i have to do a coupl step first befor i can do boxing" or mayb it nutrit that you'r interest in chang
306 c: but if we were to talk about a plan would that be interest to you 10:13 ?
117 t: yeah
305 c: okay so what would you rather focus on today ? would you rather look at chang some eat habit or would you rather focus on chang physic activ ?
112 t: probabl eat habit
305 c: okay alright so if you think for a moment about thing you'v alreadi tri and thing you might like to tri what come to mind for you ?
120 t: can you give me like an exampl ?
302 c: mm-hmm yeah so some peopl set a goal for themselv where they say "you know i'v alreadi tri cut down on sugar" and they don't realli have that much now "so i think that i'm go to tri eat fewer calori per meal or smaller portions" other peopl might say "you know i feel like i could have more fruit and veget in my diet and so mayb that what i should focus on first"
305 c: but do you have ani idea like that ?
113 t: yeah eat more healthier and tri not to like if your friend tell you to go and eat some sugar tri not to do it forc yourself not to eat the sugar
305 c: okay and has that been pretti success for you so far or do you feel like that someth you need to work on ?
120 t: what ? to have 11:32
330 c: to cut down on sugar ? you feel like
107 t: like my brain tell me to eat a lot of stuff then my mind tell me "don't eat it" so
346 c: okay is that work pretti well for you right now ?
112 t: sometim
302 c: yeah ? is that the reason that i'm ask is i'm wonder if that someth you would like to focus on improv or if you feel like you'r alreadi do well enough in that area and mayb there someth differ relat to eat that you'd like to focus on
112 t: i'd like to improv on it
302 c: okay great so i'm tri to think if i have some thing in here that we might look at if that okay it might give you some idea let see here so you'r talk a lot about sugar in particular i guess if you want to make some chang in that area here are some idea that might be help to you so some peopl decid we'll start with this one some peopl decid that one thing to cut down on is sugar in your drink okay so they might just choos to make a chang like mayb not drink pop or fruit juic as much for exampl and so you can see here although this isn't just sugar calori are an import part of what will help you with weight loss fewer calori mean less weight okay anoth idea and this one a littl bit differ too this isn't necessarili sugar but it calori
349 c: do you eat out veri often ?
112 t: not realli
302 c: okay so this one might not be as help to you but this idea is basic if you were to eat out or eat these kind of food at home here are healthi choic versus unhealthi choic you get the choic between the two
305 c: so i'm go to put that one to the side for right now or leav it on the tabl for you to choos from but you said it might not be the most help to you
302 c: here anoth one and this might be relev for sugar- relat this help with portion size mean how much of a serv you have at one time and so if for exampl you did have a sugari food or your mind told you you want one food but you tri to say "you know i think i'm just go to toss it off or have someth else" this might be a way to you to get at that is think about how much food you have at each serv and that way it might not be the case that you alway have to say "you know no i'm not go to have anyth right now" you might just choos to have a differ size and the last thing that we might think about work on today in a plan for you is just keep track of what you eat so that you can see better where you could make some help chang so some peopl find it realli help to write down like the day and time that they eat even if it just a snack and what they eat and there some other categori here that might be help but probabl the next most import one is how mani calori the food has
119 t: i had did that befor i wrote it in a journal but i just wrote like what i ate and what time and stuff
311 c: okay okay so you know you alreadi have some experi do that
306 c: and did you feel comfort with it ?
117 t: yeah
119 t: i kept track of what i ate and all that stuff
331 c: how do you think that help you ?
112 t: it help me a lot becaus sometim i had over and the portion size
311 c: mm-hmm and you probabl wouldn't have known that necessarili if you hadn't it written down
306 c: is that what you'r think ?
305 c: okay so is that someth that you would like to tri again or would you like to tri
106 t: yeah tri again
302 c: okay okay well let me put these away for now and you'r go to get these to take home with you becaus it may be the case that onc you get good at do this you might decid you want to do one of these other thing too
313 c: so befor you said that you wrote down just the time and what the food was
333 c: do you feel like it would be help for you to do that or how help do you think it might be to add some addit inform like calori ?
112 t: it'd be help
346 c: do you know how to count calori ?
117 t: no
301 c: no laugh okay so i unfortun don't have enough time to show you everyth that you would need to know today though
346 c: do you have somebodi who might be abl to help you count calori ?
117 t: yes
346 c: who could help you with that ?
112 t: my mom or my grandma or my aunt
308 c: okay so you have three differ peopl in your life who could show you how to count calori
305 c: which is excel that more than a lot of peopl have so so i guess if you and i think about what you would like to work on particular you could think about you want to work on log your food but a piec of that seem like it learn how to count calori too it almost like you have two goal in one huh ?
112 t: yeah like when i'm with my aunti she like when we go like groceri shop or someth she'll say "look at the back at the calori log" and i'll look at it and i'll be like "how do you read this" ? so
331 c: how import do you think it is to have that inform ?
112 t: count calori ? it import caus it how much you eat and how much sugar or fat or anyth that in the food 17:35 what you put into your bodi
349 c: right right have you ever had the experi where you eat a small piec of food but it has a lot of calori in it ?
117 t: yes
348 c: and then what about if the opposit like you have a bigger piec of food that doesn't have
112 t: has less calori
348 c: what an exampl of a time that that happen to you ?
119 t: like i ate like a i think it was a cooki and it was like a littl cooki like i ate half of it and then later i ate the other half of it and it was onli like less of it in the half form then you put it both togeth and it was kinda more of it
313 c: oh okay so you saw that have a smaller portion gave you smaller calori
348 c: would you have gotten just as fill up if you had like an appl even a big appl do you think ?
112 t: yeah if i ate a whole appl i'll get full and probabl i won't eat noth els for two three hour
308 c: wow that pretti good to know about yourself
346 c: do you feel like appl have more or less calori than cooki ?
112 t: it feel like it has less calori caus it healthi
311 c: yeah yeah so appl have less calori than cooki and it sound like they realli fill you up too so that a realli handi thing to know huh ? laugh
305 c: okay well so if you and i want to come up with a plan that you can take home and use would that be okay with you ?
117 t: mm-hmm
302 c: okay i do have one that we can use if you'd like to take a look at it see this is a blank one you and i would have to either fill it out or talk through it basic this is a littl plan that we have to help peopl put their idea down on paper or at least put them in their head and so what we could do is decid what your plan is that you'd like to do and you mention log and learn how to count calori we talk about whi it is import to you that you write that down and then an import part is know what the barrier might be mean know what could stop you from be abl to use your plan
301 c: so whi is that so import to you ?
120 t: right it down here ?
301 c: yeah so you can write it down it in this section right here
302 c: alrighti so you have an import goal and you have an import reason for do your goal or for tri to achiev your goal now what about this part ? no matter how much somebodi want to do someth there could be thing that could make it difficult or that could even stop them from do it
359 c: can you think of anyth that would stop you from log and learn how to count calori ?
120 t: write it down ?
308 c: sure yeah you have lot of good idea
120 t: hey so you write down what get on the way like if you have someth els to do ?
326 c: that could be one thing
305 c: would it be help for you to just talk about it for a minut and then write it down ?
117 t: yeah
309 c: okay so that a realli good point
302 c: so for some peopl they might be in a rush or have someth els to do and so they don't have time to do their log so that would be one thing that could get in the way it might not alway but sometim it could
344 c: but what other thing prevent you from do stuff that you realli want to do like log for exampl ?
109 t: i might have someth more import to do or the other thing that you do take up more time like it take half of the day you don't have time to
326 c: okay so two big thing i hear you say is other thing to do and not enough time
359 c: can you think of anyth els that would stop you ?
109 t: patienc
305 c: okay so like if you would you run out of patienc is that what you'r think ?
117 t: yeah
344 c: okay so what other thing can you think of ?
308 c: you have three realli great idea
117 t: that about it
301 c: okay so what if you were to write down those three thing other thing to do not enough time and patienc ?
308 c: okay so you came up with some realli good idea
302 c: and i hear these thing a lot from peopl that if they'r go to get slow down by someth those are the kind of thing that will make it difficult for them to reach their goal
333 c: so if you think about each of those three thing time patienc and other thing to do if one of those start to come up or you thought it might get in your way what do you think you could do to stop it from get in your way ?
106 t: do it at a time where you have time and patienc
313 c: okay so it almost look like you'd have to pick a time dure the day you know would work better for you
308 c: okay that a realli great solut make it easi on yourself huh ?
346 c: can you think of anyth els that would help you ?
117 t: no
302 c: okay if i could make one suggest would that be okay ? so some peopl find that when they start to run out of patienc that if they keep work that they realli realli run out of patienc and so sometim it okay just to set it asid for a minut and say "you know what ? i'm just get upset here i'm go to take a break for about five minut and then come back and tri again" and they might even just ask somebodi to help them so you could say like for exampl
346 c: your mom help you out a lot ?
117 t: mm-hmm
302 c: you might say "mom i'm have a realli hard time figur out the calori in this meal can you help me" ? and those might be help thing
305 c: could you see those work for you ?
117 t: yes
301 c: okay so you know let see we have here the first step you can take today to reach your goal
305 c: so if your goal overal is to start log each day and to learn how to do calori count so that you can put that on your log what do you think the veri first thing you would do today is ?
106 t: go find a journal and write down what i eat and what time and how mani calori
313 c: okay alright so the veri first thing is to get a journal
308 c: you know what i realli like about what you said about find a journal is that you ha- it almost seem like you have this idea that "if i'm go to do this i'm go to do it for real i'm go to get a journal where there are lot of page caus i'm go to fill them up" so that a realli great way to start out is know alreadi that you'r go to stick with it
331 c: so what about somebodi who can help you ?
301 c: in this bottom part what you will put here is someth like a person name or relationship to you could do to help me reach my goal
120 t: can you put more than one person ?
301 c: mm-hmm yeah you can put as mani peopl as you want
120 t: 27:57
331 c: what do you think they would do to help you reach your goal ?
305 c: what would you want them to do for you ?
311 c: so let see can i look at what you wrote down ?
346 c: thank so let see "help watch what i eat and how much" so you'r realli feel like you could use some help with some peopl kind of do you want them to watch over or do you just want to check in with them ?
112 t: both
311 c: both okay so you realli see that it go to take a lot of peopl to help you out and i think you'r right
302 c: anytim peopl make big chang it doe take a lot of people; it harder to do on your own than it is when you have lot of peopl help you
308 c: so that a super good thought
310 c: so this log right here you can take home with you also and this might be enough to get you start at least for a coupl of meal caus you have thing down on each of the line so until you get a journal this will give you a good start anyway
306 c: okay so what question can i answer for you about your plan or about other thing we'v talk about ?
120 t: do you have a food chart ? like the food
346 c: like a pyramid ?
117 t: yeah
302 c: i don't i might be abl to find one for you though so mayb befor you leav i can tri to look one up on the internet and print it out for you
117 t: okay
308 c: okay ? that a realli good question
346 c: are you familiar with my pyramid ?
117 t: yeah
331 c: yeah what do you like about it ?
112 t: i like the way like it tell you like what it is and how much calori it is and the color
309 c: oh okay okay good point
301 c: so well from here what i usual do is i take 30:07 into the wait room and our research assist who work with you earlier they might have someth for you to do but i'm go to meet with your mom for a few minut now if you would like to share this plan with your mom we could do it in a coupl differ way one way is to just wait until all three of us come back togeth and you can share it with your mom anoth way that some peopl like to do is to have me share it with her and then to talk about it again when the three of you come back togeth
305 c: what would work best for you ?
117 t: i realli don't know
305 c: okay well do you feel comfort with me talk it over with your mom so that she has an idea of what you'v been work with ?
117 t: yeah
305 c: okay would you be okay with me show her what you work out ?
301 c: okay so then what i'll do is i'll talk with her a littl bit about it and she and i will come up with a plan too for her and for how she can help you and when the three of us come back togeth what i'll do is one of the thing i'll do actual is ask you if you would share your plan with your mom know that she alreadi seen it so that'll be a littl bit easier to kind of go through it with her say what you'd like to work on and what you'r hope to get out of that mean to be more healthi and find it easier to do the thing you want to do
306 c: okay ? do you have ani question ?
117 t: no
308 c: okay you'v been veri veri help you seem to know a lot about this you definit have a lot of peopl readi to help you out on everyth
301 c: i'll just put these back togeth and then i will take you in the other room lose track of my pen too here it is alrighti
