328 c: i'll get it later
305 c: so around the begin of school you made two big chang you start work out in the gym at lunchtim and you stop eat junk food so how has that been for you ?
112 t: it been better
331 c: yeah in what way ?
112 t: caus like now when i start go to the gym they don't say noth to me
311 c: okay so peopl have notic what you'v been do and they'v stop talk in way that you don't like that must feel pretti good
333 c: so and the junk food you said where have you stop eat junk food ?
120 t: hmm ?
333 c: where have you stop eat junk food ?
119 t: at home
331 c: okay so how were you abl to stop do that ? i would imagin that you'r probabl not the person who doe the shop so did someon help you ?
106 t: caus like when my famili eat junk food they offer me some i just say no
313 c: okay so you'v made a person choic to turn it down when somebodi offer you if you want some ?
308 c: well that pretti commend mean that i mean that that realli take a lot of effort for a person to be abl to do that pretti success
305 c: do you feel like that someth that you want to keep up with ? what do you think it might take for you to be abl to keep do those two thing ?
112 t: i guess mind my own busi and whatev peopl say about you just ignor it
313 c: okay so that a third chang that you'v made is you'v decid to respond to peopl differ
120 t: and one day it was one of these boy in my school he just kept call my name and call me 9:46 then yesterday i got angri caus he just ran up to me and just slap me so i just got up and just slap him real hard and the princip said i got suspend caus i hit him but he hit me but he didn't get suspend
346 c: was that part of your choic for decid that you would respond differ to peopl ? did that help you make that choic ?
117 t: yeah
313 c: well these are some pretti big chang that you'v made recent do you feel confid that you can keep up with those chang ?
117 t: mm-hmm
331 c: how confid do you feel ? like if i said "tell me on a scale of one to ten with one be "probabl tomorrow i'm not go to do it anymore" and ten be "yup i feel i can do that for the rest of my life"
113 t: ten
308 c: wow ! that pretti confid ?
331 c: what make you feel like a ten and not a seven or an eight ?
106 t: becaus like i look at peopl when they'r eat and the onli thing they'r eat is sugar and that when i just everi time i go to the store caus i usual go to the store everi day everi time i go to the store they'd think i was get some ruffl but i just go back there and get me a juic
313 c: okay okay so what you'r tell me is that you feel confid at the level of a ten becaus when you look around you ?
302 c: well so when peopl decid that they would like to work on weight loss they do some of the veri same thing that you'v done they make choic to do someth differ and usual peopl choos to chang someth about their activ level which you'v start do becaus you'r work out at lunch time and they also decid to chang someth about the way that they eat which you'r do also becaus you'r cut out junk food and sugar so if you want to keep work on those kind of thing i might be abl to help you come up with anoth idea that you might choos to work on
306 c: would that be okay ? okay
305 c: so what els do you feel like you might like to work on ? what other area do you want to make some chang in ?
120 t: mmm like i like at school i just get in troubl for no real reason becaus this other person is my friend he'll just keep call me and the teacher go to say i'm get in troubl caus but i'm ain't even do noth caus i wasn't even talk to him then she'll still say i'm get in troubl
302 c: mmm yeah that sound like someth realli worth check into to see what the kind of chang you could mak
306 c: is that someth mayb that your guidanc counselor or social worker at school could help you with ?
302 c: okay so mayb that one step you could take would be to talk to your guidanc counselor or social worker about how to not get in troubl when this guy is talk to you and you feel like you'r get blame for it
305 c: but if you and i were to come up with a plan for someth that you would like to work on as far as weight loss goe would you be interest in do someth more as far as activ goe or would you be interest in make a differ anoth chang as far as food goe ?
308 c: or would you be interest in make a differ anoth chang as far as food goe ? i mean i think the one that you'r do are great but i'd like to help you even more
112 t: as far as activ caus i want to do like more activ
330 c: okay
106 t: like i play footbal but i don't like that the footbal team that i'm play with caus everi game we play they'll get mad at me just becaus i didn't catch the ball
312 c: mm-hmm hmm so it sound as though a lot of the difficulti that you have are relat to how peopl react to you
306 c: is that right ?
120 t: hmm ?
312 c: it sound like a lot of the difficulti that you have are relat to how peopl react to you so you play footbal and sometim you don't cat ?
302 c: which is true i think of everybodi nobodi catch it a hundr percent of the time
306 c: right ?
117 t: right
310 c: but are you think mayb get out and practic a littl bit more would be help or ?
120 t: get out and practic a littl bit more ?
310 c: mm-hmm and that an idea that can help with weight loss too becaus the more activ you are the more that can help you in two area right ? one with your health and one with how skill you are at catch the ball ok
302 c: so sometim when peopl think about what kind of chang they want to make they come up with a plan they decid "you know here what i realli want to work on i want to practic more" and then we can either talk about a plan or we could write it down so that you could rememb it more easili
305 c: what would be better for you ?
112 t: we could write it down
301 c: okay i have a littl sheet in here that we can use if that okay to write it down on ?
305 c: and sinc you can probabl put it into your own word better than i can would it be okay if i have you write it ?
117 t: mm-hmm
301 c: okay i'll give you someth to work on too huh ? laugh so whoop you know what ? i think i gave you the one that i would use for your mom here we go this one for the teen that you so this is just a plan that help peopl think about what kind of chang they would like to make and you mention that you would like to practic footbal more often and so you might say "mi plan is to" and then we can think about like how often do you think would be most help to you ? for two reason you mention you want to get better at play footbal and we also thought about practic more will help with weight too
333 c: so how often do you think you might practic ?
106 t: like everi day we don't have a game we have to practic
333 c: mm-hmm so what would be differ that you could do from what you'r alreadi do ?
302 c: so mayb this will help i have a sheet in here i can show you if that interest to you let see so one of the thing that we know about how activ relat to weight loss and in this case it could also be help with give you more practic time is that this is what recommend for activ if peopl were to be activ three day a week for 60 minut each day high intens do you know what that mean ? it kind of like if you think about when you are activ enough that you can feel your heart beat and like if you were to tri to like sing the happi birthday song for exampl like you wouldn't be abl to you might be abl to say it but you wouldn't be abl to sing it becaus you'r work that hard ?
306 c: have you ever been that activ ?
327 c: so you kind of have an idea of what that might feel like
343 c: so what doe your bodi feel like when you'r that activ that you can't sing the happi birthday song ?
302 c: okay so mayb not quit at the level where you'r readi to pass out but just befor that where you feel like mayb you'r sweat and you feel like you'r heart beat and you feel like you could keep go but it not veri easi
109 t: like that
302 c: yeah yeah exact so some of the thing that you might do for that 60 minut includ a warm up so a littl bit of stretch your aerob exercis for the 60 minut
106 t: i do that too
302 c: and stretch afterward you do some kickbox ? so mayb this will give you some idea here anoth one like walk fast so if you were to and run caus that the kind of stuff that you would do in footbal right ? so those are some differ idea ?
331 c: so if you were practic where would you do your practic ?
112 t: there an open field by the school that i go to
311 c: by the school that you go to ? okay ?
331 c: are you abl to get there pretti easili ?
117 t: mm-hmm
306 c: and it okay with your famili if you go ? okay
311 c: okay so you have a place to go you have an idea of what to do
112 t: yeah and like when i was train for kickbox i live in the same complex with my trainer he'll just take me
311 c: oh okay so you have somebodi that could help you ? alrighti so i'm go to make sure that you get this sheet so you can refer back to it later and make sure that you rememb some of the idea that we talk about okay ?
301 c: so i'm go to make sure that you get this sheet so you can refer back to it later and make sure that you rememb some of the idea that we talk about okay ? so as far as your plan goe you had a plan to practic footbal more often
112 t: like two hour
306 c: okay and how often are you say two hour per week or two hour per day ?
112 t: two hour per day
302 c: okay so that even more than what this recommend ?
306 c: are you think everi day or just certain day ?
112 t: everi day
347 c: okay is that someth you think you'd be abl to keep up with ? so well you know let write down your plan then ?
327 c: so well you know let write down your plan then so you could write right here "mi plan is to practic footbal two hour per day" just wanna stick this away 21:25 so we don't forget to give it to you
308 c: i like that plan becaus it help you to do someth that you like and it'll help you out too in a coupl area
331 c: so now the next part is whi do you want to do that ? whi is that import to you ?
112 t: 21:56 my throw i mean to practic on my catch
331 c: what about for weight loss ? what about that is import for chang in your weight ?
311 c: i know that you have a coupl differ reason whi you would like to practic footbal
118 t: mmm
331 c: so mayb if we take a step back for a minut and think whi is it import for you to make chang that will your weight be a healthier weight ? what are the main reason for that ?
112 t: so i can run better
308 c: okay that an import one help you do someth you realli want to do now here where we think about some of the thing that could get in the way and make it difficult for you to be abl to do that everi day ?
311 c: okay so practic two hour per day is so that you can run better is the main thing that you want to work on right now on top of the nice chang that you'v alreadi made
301 c: now here where we think about some of the thing that could get in the way and make it difficult for you to be abl to do that everi day and if we know what those are and we can plan how you might deal with them if they come then you'r more like to be abl to be success with your plan
306 c: doe that make sens ?
344 c: <cat>302</cat>
360 c: what stop you ?
109 t: my team
332 c: okay so now would your team stop you from practic on your own ?
109 t: yeah caus i got to show up to practic everi day when i realli don't want to
312 c: oh okay and i heard you just say someth "when you realli don't want to"
306 c: is that what you said ?
312 c: so mayb that someth that might also get in the way here if you do extra practic
347 c: what about if you have a day when you say "you know i said to myself i was go to practic two extra hour a day but i realli don't want to" could you imagin yourself say someth like that ?
323 c: no ?
344 c: well what do you imagin might stop you from do your two hour of extra practic ?
109 t: school
301 c: okay so you could write that down
330 c: so if school get in your way
344 c: can you think of anyth els that might get in your way ?
109 t: friend
308 c: okay that pretti smart of you to think about these kind of thing ?
329 c: i can imagin that they would mayb get in your way sometim
344 c: can you think of anyth els ?
323 c: no ?
333 c: okay so then now what we do is we think if school get in your way then tri this like what an altern someth differ you could do that would allow you to still do your extra practic even if you have school ?
111 t: some day i would have to miss like some day i get a choic if i can either miss school or go to school but i rather go to school than miss it
308 c: mm-hmm that a pretti smart decis ?
324 c: i think i'd rather go to school than miss it too
333 c: so okay so let say that it not the case that you could just miss school just to practic what els could you do to make sure that you could get your practic in on school day ?
112 t: like if i miss practic by the open field i could just go home and go to the park and practic by myself with my other friend
329 c: okay so let see help me to understand a littl bit more about that caus i think i might be miss some of what you'r talking-it hard for me to pictur what you'r talk about caus i don't know where you live or go to school
109 t: like some day my princip after school he'll tell me and my other friend we got to stay after school for some it this event come up in my school we'r gonna have to stay after school
306 c: okay so if school get in your way from practic what you'r realli talk about then is if you have to stay after school ?
333 c: okay so then what could you do on those day ?
112 t: i could practic with my friend when i get back
308 c: oh great write that down that great what a good solut practic with your friend when you get bac ?
329 c: i like that idea of mayb just say "well if i can't practic right after school then i can still practic later"
333 c: now what about if you mention friend could get in the way of your practic ? how do you think we could solv that if that becom an issu ?
332 c: well mayb the first thing to talk about is how could friend get your way of do your practic ?
112 t: go to practic and talk to my friend later
308 c: mm-hmm that a realli nice way to think about it is to just decid that you'll practic first and talk to friend after ?
310 c: some peopl even invit their friend to do the extra practic with them
306 c: is that someth your friend would do ?
311 c: so now you have two solut then you might even say invit your friend to do extra practic with you
305 c: what do you think about your plan so far ? it pretti good one ? so let see so the next step say "the first step that i can take in order to reach my goal which is do extra practic is what" ? like what the veri first thing you think you need to do to start do extra practic two hour a day ?
106 t: like eat more fruit and veget
313 c: okay so eat more fruit and some veget ?
331 c: and how do you think that that will help you to do your extra practic ? how do you think that eat more fruit and veget will help you to do extra footbal practic ?
112 t: like it'll give me more the fruit will give me more energi
309 c: beauti i like the way you think about these thing
301 c: so mayb you could write that there as a remind "eat more fruit and veget becaus it will give me more energy"
329 c: i like the way you think about these thing
301 c: okay then you see what the last line say ?
119 t: someth 32:33 to help me reach my goal
301 c: yeah so we should probabl think about it's-peopl general find that it a littl harder to do thing when they tri to do it all by themselv with nobodi help them so we want peopl to think a littl bit about who could help them who could be support to them
112 t: my famili
331 c: okay is there ani one particular famili member that could help you ?
112 t: my friend 33:11
311 c: 33:14  ?
331 c: and who in your famili could help you too ?
112 t: my uncl
331 c: okay and how do you think that those two peopl could help you ?
112 t: well they can get me focus
331 c: okay how do they get you focus ?
112 t: by like they'll tell me to 33:54 look at other stuff
328 c: okay paus so now you have a plan in your own word that you'r go to practic two extra hour a day for footbal and you'r go to do that so that you can run a littl bit better you'r go to make s- you have a plan in case some thing get in your way and you know who go to help you you also know the veri first step to take ?
333 c: so what do you think you might do with this plan ?
106 t: just work with it and see what i can do
302 c: mm-hmm yeah some peopl also find that they have to well peopl have told me that when they hang it up somewher where they can see it like mayb on their fridg or someth that it help becaus it remind them everi day ?
305 c: what do you think that you might do to remind yourself ?
106 t: like when i wake up i can just put it on my wall so when i wake up it'll just be look in my face
309 c: oh okay good think
333 c: so you'r go to put it on your wall right where you see it when you first wake up
301 c: okay well so at this point in our meet we'v come up with a good plan for you and in a moment i'm go to talk to is it your mom that came with you right ? i'm go to talk to your mom for a few minut and she and i are go to do someth similar is talk through how she can be support to you okay ?
305 c: and it up to you if you would like to talk about your plan or not do you think that would be a good idea ?
117 t: mm-hmm
