308 c: so you just name the two biggest healthi way that peopl go about lose weight not everybodi know that stuff right off the top of their head that pretti impress
345 c: so what are some reason that peopl want to lose weight ?
119 t: caus they too big don't like the way they look
327 c: so it realli is this idea of what they look like and how they kind of feel insid their bodi
119 t: how other peopl think they look like
327 c: so what other peopl are tell them not necessarili how they feel
302 c: so sometim for those peopl it kind of hard becaus if they feel okay and other peopl are tell them that they should do certain thing it not realli fun might not be fun for them so i have a littl inform about extra weight and when peopl are in overweight status would that be someth you'd want to hear about ? so there you know is this idea that a lot of time there are certain health problem that can develop when peopl re overweight and thing like they can have problem with blood pressur and problem with thing like develop diabet as they get older
306 c: what do you think about that kind of stuff in term of you know if peopl are you know have a weight problem ? so this is new info not someth you'v heard befor ?
307 c: and it can be kind of scari to think about you know have a diseas becaus of the way that as you know what you weigh
301 c: so what should we talk about dure our time ?

331 c: you'll be lose weight ?
112 t: mm-hmm becaus i won't need nobodi to take me nowher and i have to do it on my own so i will be abl to do it on my own
311 c: so other peopl tell you what to do and how to lose weight isn't the way you want to do it
112 t: well i'm talk about like jog 0:15:579 everywher like i can go to place by myself instead of with everybodi els
311 c: you'll be in more control of what you'r do
331 c: what kind of place will you go to ? you got your car what kind of car is it ? ani car no special car just some wheel ? so you got your key and you got your car and you see yourself you know when you got those thing you see yourself lose weight tell me a littl bit more about that
310 c: there some place that you'll be abl to go when you'r 17 and you have your own car and licens that you can't go right now those will help you with lose weight
112 t: i wasn't think about a car i was think about walk around instead of drive my mom said she would buy me a car when i turn 16
310 c: but you'r not sure if you want a car when you'r 16
345 c: what would you like when you'r 16 ?
311 c: caus you mention think about walk around
120 t: i know when i'm 16 
312 c: well it almost sound like it this idea that you know if you get in the car you'r not go to be as activ caus you won't be walk around
120 t: unless you move the gas pedal and brake back and forth back and forth
311 c: and you don't see yourself lose much weight if you'r drive more instead of do the walk around
331 c: so what make you want to be lose weight when you get older ?
112 t: becaus i'm too big
311 c: so get smaller is someth that you'd like to do
114 t: but not too small becaus i don't like be small i'd rather be big than small
311 c: so don't mean too small find that balanc
333 c: well how do you think you'll get smaller ?
112 t: by lose weight
311 c: so you know yeah lose weight
333 c: what type of thing do you want to do to lose weight to get smaller ?
112 t: ride around on my bike roller-sk eat better
311 c: so you have some idea about the food again and the activ stuff
302 c: i have some inform on the activ stuff sinc you'r bring that up want to take a peek ? so here one of the handout is in here
323 c: someth on here surpris you ?
119 t: they said 20 minut don't you suppos to go longer than 20 minut caus 20 minut can't do much
311 c: so you'v actual heard some stuff about how much activ you'r suppos to do like how long it suppos to last
107 t: my mom said the doctor told her 30 minut we usual go about an hour and a half around the track jog or walk hour and a half
311 c: so this is someth that you know you'v actual heard stuff about like spend a half an hour
313 c: and you'r not you know just spend half an hour you'r go for three time like an hour and a half you went around
333 c: how often do you do that ?
107 t: mayb three or four time a week
313 c: so it sound like you have a pretti steadi schedul do that
360 c: you want to go out there ?
120 t: hmm ?
360 c: you want to go out there ?
120 t: there not noth to do out there
327 c: it kind of bore in here isn't it
331 c: so what make you go to the track three or four time a week =
111 t: to walk to run jog like to go to the playground and play but i don't get to do that 0:22:149 my friend
328 c: so it one way for you to just kind of do thing and also go to the playground with your friend is anoth thing you like to do so you have a pretti steadi schedul of go few time a week to the track and you even notic that this idea of the 20 minut of stretch isn't you know isn't go to do anyth it not enough to realli see chang in health and weight you'r do more than that and even the goal of do 60 minut everi day build up to 60 minut everi day on the day you go to the track you'r do more than that
331 c: so what are the thing what are some of the thing you like about go to the track ?
120 t: there noth you can do there except walk around
311 c: so it not that excit to be there so you might as well do some activ
331 c: what make you go do activ when you you know befor you decid as
309 c: you'r pretti good at eye circl
307 c: do pretti as oh i hope i didn't as i didn't want to embarrass you by say that
360 c: do those thing probabl help you stay less bore and stay awak when you'r talk to me ?
120 t: no just inaud
329 c: say it again i didn't even hear you i'm sorri =
120 t: i just did them inaud
305 c: no big deal keep go if you'd like
313 c: so right now you'r do about three or four day a week of go to the track
333 c: how long have you been do that for ?
106 t: about mayb two month becaus i'v been in school a few month
313 c: so it been a pretti you know solid period of time that you'v been do it and you'r go with peopl in your famili when you go to the track
333 c: who do you go with ?
112 t: my mom sometim my sister and my nephew my nephew go everi time he over to our hous
327 c: so he realli like to go
120 t: and ride his bike he onli three though so he can just like ride his bike around the track
328 c: so he littl but you'v got a lot you know him he there your mom sometim your sister peopl to go with and they'r realli isn't anyth fun about go it just kind of bore so you go and you do some activ and you go home
331 c: so if there realli noth fun that go on when you'r there whi do you go ?
111 t: caus my mom go caus my mom will go inaud noth els to do at home pretti much inaud and ride my bike i would rather ride my bike there than at home up and down the street
311 c: so number one your mom kind of say "okay we'r go and" =
111 t: no she say she go and she ask me do i want to go i say yes most of the time becaus i don't like stay at home or ride my bike up and down the street and around the corner
311 c: so it get you tout of the hous and it fun to go up there and take your bike
305 c: and it not even that she make you go you decid that you want to go
331 c: so you know on a scale of like one to ten where one is not at all import and ten is veri veri veri import how import is it to you to go to the track like that on a regular basi =
119 t: to lose weight or go to the track ?
305 c: so you kind of want to see the differ if the question was ask about lose weight or go to the track
113 t: go to the track seven i'll say but i'll say lose weight i'll say mayb a nine nine or ten
311 c: so just go to the track to go to the track i mean you'r up there and it kind of import when you put it into lose weight you'r up you know to nine it darn close to veri veri veri import it up there
331 c: what make it a nine and not a lower number like a seven ?
111 t: becaus i be proud i don't want to be skinni i just want to lose weight not skinni
312 c: so you know get rid of this idea of you know you don't want to be skinni but you do =
112 t: i don't want to be big either you want to be in the middl
311 c: you want to be in the middl and go to the track and do the activ is one way that you can work to get smaller but not too small
308 c: pretti smart in there in term of get in your regular physic activ
331 c: what would it take to bump you up to a ten ?
112 t: lose weight
310 c: so actual see some result you haven't seen ani yet
116 t: well i don't think caus i don't have no scale inaud scale you know and the other one said inaud that where i most be at on the weekend it bore at my hous and go and walk the dog
313 c: so you'r find way to be activ even when you'r not at home you know when you'r over at other peopl hous and thing
311 c: and if you if you had a way to like you said a scale at home or other place that you could kind of keep track of your weight you might like that a littl bit more becaus then you would know so you'd see result that you have
333 c: well how do you how do you go about like get a scale at home if that was someth that you want to =
106 t: buy it i guess buy it or tell mom to buy it inaud
310 c: so you could ask your mom to get that for you if you want but you'r not realli sure if have a scale is you know go to be the way that you want to see if you'r lose weight or not
331 c: but what are some other way that you could tell if it was work ?
309 c: becaus you'r absolut right
302 c: like a lot of time when peopl are tri to see how they'r do they weigh themselv almost everi day just to see if what they'r do =
112 t: mayb weigh themselv they should weigh themselv mayb onc everi two week caus if you keep on weigh yourself you go to think you'r not lose no weight
311 c: so you'r think that if it too close togeth it go to be too small but if you'r wait for long enough then you'll see differ then
302 c: and so i got as i have some info on the weigh stuff want to hear it ?
360 c: becaus peopl who who are do chang to help themselv lose weight like be activ or make chang to their eat habit if they weigh themselv it a realli great way for them to keep track oh do you want to take care of anyth ? i can =
120 t: no i was tell this
360 c: oh you'r on a timelin ?
120 t: yes i mean no well i suppos to go inaud i was suppos to went to the doctor today inaud go to a parti at 5:00 inaud
301 c: so you want to get to a parti so we should see about =
360 c: = wrap thing up no ?
120 t: no caus my mom would be mad
301 c: okay so without kind of you know say to your mom "now i know you have to go to a parti so we should get you out of here" we should see about get out of here soon if we can
328 c: huh well we were talk about the weigh the scale stuff and i think i had said that peopl that weigh themselv have you know that a realli great way for peopl to tell if what they'r do is work or not then they can make adjust from there
308 c: so your idea of look at a scale and see feedback is pretti cool and pretti smart in term of check yourself for the weight loss
328 c: you mention that you could ask your mom for a scale if you want to get one
120 t: inaud
327 c: oh sorri
331 c: what would she say if you ask her for a scale ?
115 t: inaud just say yes she might say no
310 c: so she would probabl say yes and now you'r say that be abl to kind of see weight loss would help you bump up to that realli veri veri veri import of keep you go on the track for that
325 c: but you'r not quit sure if you want to ask her or not about the scale
116 t: probabl better not becaus i don't want inaud and if i did want to weigh myself i wouldn't want to spend it just go and buy one becaus i'm not go to hard use it so i just go along becaus like on the weekend when i go over there i could use his scale or use my aunti scale inaud
311 c: so you'r be real i mean you know you don't need one at home you have one over at your uncl to weigh yourself at and they don't mind you use that whenev you go over
117 t: no
302 c: but you know sometim peopl when they'r weigh themselv they write down what they weigh that help them keep track of thing
306 c: how would that work for you ?
310 c: you don't realli want not interest in write down what you weigh
114 t: i am but  just 
325 c: there someth about it that stop you
114 t: no i'm just 
311 c: so you'r interest in write down what you weigh
120 t: i know i  0:35:349 forget her name
360 c: toya or sara ?
120 t: sara i think sara i think it was inaud i was wrong
360 c: shetoya ?
119 t: oh no it was sara she inaud she took my weight
311 c: so you do know what you weigh right now
114 t: no becaus i didn't look at it i didn't look at it i don't want inaud but i did but i didn't look becaus i didn't know if it would chang the number inaud
301 c: so you were go to look at your weight but it wasn't there for long enough for you to grab it well if that someth that you would like to know befor you go just let me know and we can find out write it down for you if you want
120 t: what is my mom do ?
301 c: she probabl just wait for you do the tast test
324 c: you'r kind of get readi to move on with this done talk with me ? oh okay yeah yeah
302 c: well sometim when peopl meet with me they'll do someth call will make a littl plan in term of either what they want to do to lose weight or what they'r think about do for lose weight some idea that they have
328 c: and we talk about some stuff today in term of your do activ about three or four time a week you know you'r think about mayb weigh yourself kind of to keep track and see what go on
306 c: you know what would your plan be ? or someth that you would be think about do to keep up with your goal of weight loss ? you'r think about it ?
116 t: not sure
310 c: so you'r not realli you'r not realli sure what it is that you want to do
112 t: i know i want to lose weight
310 c: you know you want to lose weight you just don't know how you want to do it
112 t: i know i want to do it on the exercis instead of as on the exercis and eat right not take that no someth they have on tv with the packet i like the packet with the stuff that you put insid of the water inaud
311 c: so you'r talk about you know lose weight a healthi way in term of make chang to eat and activ not the stuff on tv that easi and littl quick plan but you do like the littl flavor water packet
310 c: not someth that you'r think about get
331 c: well who somebodi that could help you with lose weight ?
112 t: my mom
311 c: your mom all right
331 c: and what could she do ? like what someth that we could kind of talk to her about when we'r togeth that would be help for you in term of lose weight ?
101 t: i don't know
310 c: so you don't realli have ani idea it just easier if she kind of tell you what she what she think that you should do and you'r cool with that all right so you'r look for her idea
301 c: all right you want to go ahead and switch with your mom ? okay cool all right so we'll kind of come back and we'll have you switch place and then we'll come back in
