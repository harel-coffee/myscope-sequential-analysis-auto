313 c: so alreadi you'r kind of lower your the amount of food or your portion that you'r have of differ food
106 t: yeah like i don't eat breakfast in the morn when i go to summer colleg you know i just get up and go out the door and then we get out like at 11:45 so we don't get noth at school so inaud been hang until like two-someth but inaud without eat or drink noth

308 c: anoth thing that this this mention is the idea of screen time in term of you know watch tv or play video game or be on the comput to do that about two hour or or less everi day and that just becaus the more time that peopl are sit down it just less time that they'r probabl move around

306 c: what do you think about do someth like that ?
116 t: hmm i realli can't say becaus throughout my whole everi day i either end up run run around or you know i would think about not eat fri chicken i'm so tire of chicken i don't even want to see chicken yeah
313 c: so you would realli think about cut out or cut down on the amount of fri chicken that you'r eat
119 t: yeah that right i'm go to eat chicken wing gonna have her friend come over and cook chicken and thing like that you know i eat one piec i might put the other one back or like you know she cook chicken and like i got so tire of it one day i guess like everi food i eat i look like "is this done" ? "this is done" i'm like "i ain't eat this she like well don't eat it then i said alright
312 c: so you have a lot of fri chicken throughout the week in your hous

313 c: so the grill chicken salad you'r a fan of
112 t: yeah i love salad and like there are all differ kind you know pasta salad and stuff like that
115 t: mm-hmm like today i don't know what i'm go to do all today me and my cousin we share a slice of appl pie and i just inaud have to get readi to come here i don't know where we'r go today
325 c: so you don't know what come as far as food later on
117 t: yeah no
305 c: well if you were go to say you know either cut down on the amount of the fri chicken you'r have or not have it whi whi would you want to do someth like that ? what would be the most import reason to do that ?
311 c: so you you saw that and realli kind of saw the the negat stuff that can happen if you eat too mani of the fri food and too much of the fast food
105 t: mcdonald is not realli that good like onli thing i get from mcdonald is their sweet tea and their bacon ranch salad their their salad is basic inaud
313 c: so you alreadi are make healthi choic when you'r go to fast food
106 t: i bare go to i don't go to taco bell no more taco bell i think taco bell is just inaud you know
305 c: it not your thing
119 t: yeah like i was sit in the driveway they had a bag with meat and they just all they do is cut it open you know just put it on you know i see whi it good you know becaus they realli don't make it someon els make it put it in the bag just throw it in there
305 c: but it not the way that you like to eat food
119 t: i want-no
328 c: so you realli have kind of said that you know it sound like the fri food and some of the the choic that you'r make when you go to fast food is is realli becaus you just don't like what can happen to your bodi if you have too much of it
112 t: like mongolian barbecu i would say is the most goodest place becaus you know they make their own food they have raw meat you know veget and fruit salad
311 c: okay so they kind of cook it right in front of you
112 t: have you been to inaud ? it nice you get your own season you know you don't have to worri about someon you know you don't know what they'r do to your food but they'r bring it out to you smell good inaud
311 c: so you realli like that idea of make your own stuff and
106 t: like i eat shrimp and chicken shrimp and chicken or just chicken and scallop or i i didn't know but i ate a piec of calamari or someth like that inaud you know the i thought it was someth els i'm like here like that good
313 c: they got you tri new stuff too yeah
115 t: yeah like tofu peopl say it good to eat tofu but i'm not sure i'm go to eat tofu
325 c: you don't realli know if you want to tri that one
328 c: okay so you have lot of idea in term of place to go that you can get fresher food as oppos to go with more of the fast food and you have some thought about cut down on the fri food like fri chicken at home what are some thing
113 t: bake chicken i love bake chicken that good
310 c: okay so realli sub out the fri and put in bake and realli cut down on all those calori from the oil
117 t: yes
344 c: mm-hmm well what are some thing that could get in the way of cut down on the fri food ?
119 t: like inaud at the hous at home
344 c: what could happen at home or ?
114 t: what could get in the way ? well noth can get in the way of me do what i need to do that i want i realli couldn't answer that you know i would say for other peopl you know they say peopl like you know like a parent she want to make chicken fri chicken and your cousin there inaud you'r think about get some bake chicken but you know you'd probabl be more like you know how some peopl say "whi are you eat this and that ? you on a diet or something" ? you know some peopl inaud you know just some peopl do that becaus it what other peopl do
305 c: but that not you
115 t: i don't take it for anybodi you know what i'm say like if someon ask me a question like what inaud or it to you you know sometim i get angri and stuff like what do you want to eat you know ? like do you want to go here or there ? like it realli doesn't matter it up to you no no it up to you and i don't realli care where we go ? inaud that that all i have to say
313 c: alright so noth go to get in your way in term of you know if you'r cut back on some of the fri food
117 t: yeah
305 c: well what the first thing that you can do in order to get to that goal of not have the fri food ?
106 t: not allow it to be cook for me or so no no probabl go find someth els in the refriger
313 c: alright so number one would be to have someth els be made and number two to have the you know go find someth els yourself
331 c: alright so you'v got some idea on that with you know what about what someth that your mom can do to help you reach your goal of not have fri ?
112 t: laugh not cook it
330 c: alright so
115 t: tell her like you know let have someth els you know she ask me what do i want i said i don't know you know you know cook someth i don't know
325 c: so she ask you what you would like to have to eat and but if you'r not realli sure and don't give her ani idea she kind of
115 t: and like sometim i'm not i wasn't realli hungri to eat it like seem like i don't know oh no you know it don't make a differ to me so i don't know
304 c: so there this balanc between you'r not quit be hungri and also not realli you know have a tast for anyth yeah you don't realli care and then also the fact that she default back to a fri food which is someth you'r stay away from
114 t: yeah but she wasn't eat fri chicken like that but you know like right now we don't have noth in our refriger it like the same thing with my aunti when you open it there noth in there you'r like go groceri shop or someth that probabl realli like whi my cousin we don't care to eat not just her but my other cousin you know they realli don't care to eat noth but we'll probabl just go about our busi forget about the food and stuff like that inaud
312 c: there aren't a lot of option around
117 t: yeah
311 c: but one thing that your mom could do would be to not cook as much of the fri
112 t: yeah like it she'll she cook like she'll just cook like a lot of steam veget veget stuff like that my grandma she stay with me you know she she bake a lot like she bake anyth you know like rib stuff like that chicken wing turkey and stuff like that
311 c: alright so member of your famili are bake instead of fri so there are some way
112 t: she like to boil stuff stuff like that
301 c: alright well we'r kind of get to the point where we'll probabl if it okay with you switch place with your mom
112 t: and like eat like more salad or someth you know bake chicken i love chicken but like if it bake it realli good i like bake stuff or you know like i mean i eat steak but as long as it cook right on the skillet stuff like that
117 t: yeah inaud
