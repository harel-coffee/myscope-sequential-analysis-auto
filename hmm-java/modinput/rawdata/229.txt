120 t: my mom
327 c: your mom okay so now we came in today to talk a littl bit about weight and some thing that we could help you with when you work with me this might be a littl bit differ from when you work with say a doctor or a nurs or somebodi els who might give you direct or tell you what you need to do i'm not go to do that what i'm here to do is to help you think of thing to do we'v found that it doesn't realli help peopl to just tell them what to do it kind of undermin the whole idea of you come up with a plan that would be benefici for you so we'r here to work togeth as a team to come up with some idea and i can help you with that okay ? okay so how about if we start out by talk about your weight and what you think about it
305 c: </sample>
328 c: okay so you'v cut down on fast food you'v made some chang to the meat that you eat and the way that they'r cook even though you don't want to be a vegetarian you recogn that there are some benefit to eat more veget and less of some other food
106 t: yeah and my sister again she doesn't like lot of green green veget but i do i eat carrot i eat canned-i don't eat can fruit becaus that not good the syrup it just gross appl the onli thing that i saw her eat like she eat a whole bunch of it in one day is appl and i was upstair at my grandma hous she took her weight my sister weigh 165 and i was soon as i got on i was 178 so i ran up and down the stair ran around for an hour came back in drunk a lot of water sat down and watch tv went back outsid and boom back again i came back in i was 195 and i serious did not get whi
347 c: you'r say that you went from 178 to 195 in a day ?
119 t: yeah all i did i didn't eat noth at all all i did is drink a lot of water go exercis away that it and i just don't get it
302 c: so you bring up an interest point and that is what we call daili fluctuat or daili chang in a person weight and i have a littl bit of inform about that if you'd like me to share it with you so for one it normal for peopl weight to fluctuat day to day so if you were to weigh yourself everi singl day one thing you might notic is that like you mention befor you might be 218 one day and then 222 and then 220 and it kind of goe back and forth the import thing is to kind of watch how that chang over time and so in let say a one month period you were to go from 218 down to say 212 or even 213 that a pretti healthi amount of weight to lose and it show a trend over time that it goe down but day to day it might not it might chang up and down a littl bit day to day the thing that you mention about the 178 to 195 i suspect it probabl just where the scale was on the floor or someth becaus that that doesn't that doesn't sound like someth that would happen for somebodi to gain that much weight
119 t: i know yeah becaus my grandma had the one that you got to step on it not electr and you hold the back of it you bring it back some so it there and i end up weigh 240 i ran upstair start cri to her she came downstair she turn the back told me to get on i was i weigh way lesser than that i was like 176 becaus i lost weight i keep go up and down up and down when i went to the last week it probabl the batteri is dead that what i was hope becaus first i was 160 then i went down to 158 then i was 160 again then i was 154 then i went back up to 175 but i said forget it
302 c: yeah so some of that some of that what you'r say is sound like normal fluctuat and some of it doesn't some of it sound like the scale or like mayb where it place so some of those littl scale with the littl dial on the top where you have to calibr it they'r not the most accur so it wouldn't be unusu to find some fluctuat that in addit to your normal fluctuat so if you were like i was mention befor with healthi weight loss if you were look at drop about one or two pound a week on averag that would be a healthi weight loss
119 t: yeah but i want to know i serious want to know do a research or someth or research it whi if you eat veget everi day if you work out everi day you do all you can to lose weight but you still stay the same weight ? i serious don't get it becaus even though okay i was bigger than what i am now i was huge and i went over my aunti hous she told me that i lost weight and i said no i didn't i still weigh the same she was like you still weigh the same but my stomach got flatter there was no roll or big ol jelli thing at all i was just exact flat but when somebodi tri to pick me up it hard to pick me up i don't get it like if you skinni you weigh that much it just so hard
331 c: well what do you know about the chang in a person bodi shape compar to the chang in their weight ?
119 t: i don't know anyth they said most water
331 c: how do you think you might find that out ?
112 t: research
308 c: yeah yeah that a good idea
331 c: do you know where you could research that ?
302 c: okay so there are a few place i can share some inform with you if you like
117 t: yes
302 c: so you could check onlin about chang in bodi shape anoth realli good place to check is with your doctor is just ask about that and about when your stomach get flatter but your weight doesn't chang what doe that mean so those are some realli good place to start
308 c: as far as how i could help you i'm hear lot of realli interest thing from you i'm hear lot of inform again you know you seem to have an interest in lose weight you also seem to have the abil to learn you know about what you need to do how to keep track of it
328 c: so we'v talk a littl bit about nutrit and chang you'v tri to make in your food we'v talk a littl bit about keep track of your weight and how you might do that we'v also talk a littl bit about research and how you might learn more
306 c: what about ani other topic ?
114 t: no i'm just like a confus littl 14 year old just veri confusedc
307 c: so let me tri to help with that then
309 c: so you'r on to some good idea right
310 c: and it might be more a matter of just find way to bring them togeth so there anoth piec i'v heard a littl bit about yet but we haven't talk a lot about and you said you sometim go and you kind of run around and you do lot of activ so that the other piec is how much physic activ doe it take
305 c: what do you think
106 t: well i actual main i usual i don't sit down all day 0:13:20 i go out in the kitchen probabl cook someth cook some mushroom put them on the pan and fri them stuff like that or walk to the store the store is like six block away from my hous so i alway like to go walk or ride my bike and ride my bike i do frequent skate two time probabl a week swim i would love to do like everi singl day but ride a bike doesn't work swim doesn't work walk doesn't work caus in sixth through eight no seventh through eighth grade in our gym class we had pe and our park is like two mile two mile long we had to run around there and we had to be there back where our start point at a specif time and i never in seventh grade i never got to that point but in eighth grade i learn that listen to some music while i work out i lost a lot of weight while i was do that i don't know how i don't know but that how we at the end of the school year had to do five lap around the whole park and i was abl to do that five lap around the whole park in 15 minut and 38 second even though i was the fourth of the last i still made it and i got an a in his class and i was happi soon as i got home i said "mom mom mom i got an award a medal" and i got on the scale and it was like so amaz becaus i was 210 in eighth grade and i went down mayb a lot to 180 and i was happi the next day i woke up right in the morn i didn't eat anyth els sinc then and i woke up and i was back to where i was i didn't get it
308 c: okay so on one hand you have a lot of experi with what it take to realli work out and get yourself to a point where you can go five time around you even won an award for do that which is great
323 c: i would be so proud too and i could see in your face how happi that made you
119 t: yeah i cri
307 c: but on the other hand i see that you'r still frustrat becaus what the scale say doesn't make sens
331 c: so what do you think about the idea of whether or not the scale is accur ?
112 t: i just feel like i wish the scale did not exist realli becaus everi time i look at the scale and i weigh this much and i'm so happi next day i get disappoint becaus i weigh more and i do not like feel that way so i usual want to stay away from scale that whi i went to the doctor i was like no no no i do not want to take my weight i do not want to take the weight but i had to in order for them to help me to figur out what wrong with me so i got on i was 222 got-that when i had my asthma attack i had an asthma attack two day ago when i went to the hospit i was 218 i was happi i was like "mom how'd that happen" ? she said she don't know "but you been work out late so" i was like realli well whi lose that littl bit becaus she said it take a specif time for you to lose all that weight so mayb i ate a lot of room servic in the hospit becaus i spent the night then i got back up to 220 i'm glad that i still lost two pound now what i expect when i get home i want to take the bus i don't want nobodi to come pick me up at all i want to take the bus so i can walk to the bust stop get on the bus walk all the way home and onc i get home i want to lose at least four pound
308 c: so you'v got it sound like you'v got a lot of motiv to realli put some of your idea into place
106 t: yes and i alway do it in a group me and my sister we alway we love to danc everi time we have like a danc bout or someth like that and we do at the end we see who lost the more weight whoever lost the more weight they either get $5 or a person that will be your slave or someth like that or have someth like that
311 c: yeah someth that you
112 t: yeah but my sister that what motiv her is if there a prize at the end i was like that just like so wrong becaus don't you want to chang for yourself not for the reward she was like "yeah but it so good to have a reward but feel good about what you did" i said i understand that but you should just-first you should start think about yourself befor you think about the reward that when she start think about it and me and her start run around the park a coupl of day and she still end up lose weight and i start gain weight
311 c: so the overal messag that i'm hear from you is that your motiv realli come from within
304 c: you realli have some goal in mind that you want to do for yourself and that the big barrier seem to be know how to do it or not know how to do it i mean like you'v got all the littl piec in place lot of differ thing that you do that sound like the right thing to do but they just don't seem to be work
109 t: i'm just like so confus right now i'v never been this confus i have been this confus befor but not about my weight i don't believ i should be weigh 220 right now becaus i don't-they say that i don't look 220 look probabl 200 mayb not 220 but it a 20 pound differ but still i don't like to be call the biggest girl in school which i'm not and my pe teacher from my high school right now she said black is beauti fat is beauti and i said i understand that i love myself but if i love myself that much i'm will to chang myself for myself and she said "i understand that" and she start help me she give me daili thing to do and when i'm unabl to do thing like caus i'm-it hard for me to exercis becaus i have disloc knee and ever sinc i was six year old i was jump off the wall not liter but i was play with my sister and i jump out the window and i land on my leg and my knee went to sideway and ever sinc then my knee can move all 0:19:39 like this and when i run i alway have to wear someth that veri veri tight around my kneecap or i'm go to end up fall if i fall on it it go to get stuck i have to come down and pop it back in place it like so hard ever sinc that happen exercis for me has been veri veri hard
312 c: okay so that someth that a barrier for you too is find a way to get the exercis in that you know has been success for you but you have this problem with your knee it make it difficult
117 t: right
346 c: you mention swim befor too is that someth that has hurt your knee or no ?
112 t: no never had my knee pop under water i'm glad realli
331 c: so what are your thought on what kind of exercis realli would work for you ?
112 t: i realli want to-it the walk that i think is two mile or one mile for the cancer i did it onc befor and i like it and i want to be i want to be a swimmer i want to be swim everi singl day everi singl hour i want to rest swim again and right away all day so what i realli want to do is do the walk the swim and the bike
311 c: okay so walk swim bike sound like exercis that you feel confid that you can do and you want to do them
117 t: yes
331 c: and then as far as nutrit goe are there some thing that you think are particular help for you ?
104 t: no i realli don't have a problem with nutrit i think i believ that i be eat the thing that are good for me that have nutrit in them but usual i probabl don't mayb i don't read the fat label that well 2% might be too much for me or someth like that i learn that it an amount that you have to have a day like calori you have to have about 202-like 2200 someth about that that all i know
302 c: so some peopl to choos you know to focus on a particular thing like they might say you know "i realli want to do this bike or swim walking" that kind of thing and so they might choos to set a goal for themselv and plan out how they might do it other peopl might choos to work on nutrit and they say "you know it seem like i'm do the right thing but i can also see some area where i could improv that would help me" so they might decid "you know mayb if i just cut out 500 calori each day if i realli look at the food i'm eat and figur out where i can trim those down a littl bit" or they might choos to focus on someth like stick to a lower calori plan overal smaller portion size that sort of thing
106 t: oh right that what i want to talk to you about the portion size now my mom my dad my sister and me we have a big thing about portion so we have these big ol dish of plate and a smaller and again smaller smaller smaller everi day for dinner we do not use the huge plate we use the portion plate now you can fill that plate up all you want to you won't be get a lot on that plate so they spread the food out like i think two day and throw it out after two day and if we still hungri you have to either eat a piec of fruit or a fruit snack or drink a lot of water when they usual say drink a lot of water befor so you end up get full after that so portion control in my famili is brilliant i like portion control
308 c: that pretti brilliant laugh  ?
305 c: and so if you were to pick a goal that i could help you with what do you think that you would like to plan out ?
112 t: i'm ask just lose some weight and the way i want to lose weight i want to make it fun i don't want to make it bore or this i want someon i want my mom and dad to motiv me to lose weight or me and my sister becaus even though she might weigh less than me mayb she still big so there noth wrong with be big but we feel that we need to chang our self for the better becaus it a big thing of high blood pressur in my famili and diabet and one we not want us to have that so 0:24:09
311 c: so your import goal realli are health relat like you find that in the futur you know that there are some risk associ with be bigger and that you would like to avoid those and so you'r take action now to do that
117 t: yes yes
308 c: it brilliant veri brilliant ?
305 c: so what particular do you want to tri to chang to accomplish your goal what like a first step that you think you could do ?
106 t: mayb just follow what i eat write down what i eat or do the math on what i eat and find out the how much calori actual eat a day and do the math and subtract ad as i finish eat that thing i subtract it for how much i still need yeah just about the food habit
302 c: it just so happen that i have someth in here that might be of help to you if you would like to look at it with me okay so let me get this out i actual do have a lot of resourc in here which i will give to you but i think we'll just focus on the thing that you just mention right now let see so what you'r talk about you describ someth call a food log
119 t: right oh yes we did this in eight grade yeah
302 c: okay so i'm go to give you a food log just want to take a moment to go over again ?
306 c: now what do you know about food log and how doe this fit with what you know ?
119 t: all i know that it how he ask the question he want us to write down what we eat a day our weight after we eat that then we mark down how much we weigh everi time we eat and everi time we eat we score it how much did you lose weight did you lose 1% of weight 2% of weight did you gain or lose and stuff like that it just a lot of question that was on the paper and he told us to circl one write down what we eat be more specif what did you put in there what the ingredi and stuff like that then when we get to school we have littl laptop and we calcul them look up the word and see what are they are they bad for you or good for you
302 c: so this one is similar in some way mean so you can start with the date and time from when you ate you can write down what you ate and drank per day so one thing would go on each line which may be what you did befor how much you ate so your portion size where did the food come from mean was it cook at home did it come from a restaur did it come from you know the corner store ? you know that kind of thing and here the calori column so you can keep track of calori this part where it say what did you substitut it for this would be kind of like you mention
120 t: with the chicken and the mushroom ?
302 c: yeah instead of fri tri to have bake you know so did you substitut bake chicken for fri yeah how mani calori did you save by do that that someth you could choos to do if you want to keep track of that so if you thought well if i substitut bake for fri how mani calori did that save me ? and how hungri were you when you sat down to eat becaus that might make a differ when peopl are realli hungri they might eat more but if you also find that a lot of time you'r have a snack when you'r not actual hungri that might be a place that could point out for yourself you know this is someth i could probabl cut out becaus here is an exampl of a time when i'm eat and i'm not actual hungri or here an exampl of a time when i had a bigger portion but i wasn't actual that hungri and by the same token you might notic wow here a time when i actual did feel hungri but i stuck to a smaller portion and i wasn't hungri afterward so you can use that as a learn tool and how did you feel so was your mood associ with eat more or less and how help is that for you so there some benefit to use a food log like this like you said so if you would like to use that one this one avail for you and i'll give that to you in your folder
117 t: okay
311 c: okay so it sound like you'r pretti set on use a food log might be the most benefici first step you could take some peopl when they identifi what would be a great first step for them they come up with a plan ?
302 c: some peopl when they identifi what would be a great first step for them they come up with a plan some peopl just think about it and keep it in their head and other one want to write it down so that they can hang it on the fridg or some place where they can see it and help stick to it
305 c: what do you think you might like to do ?
112 t: i'm 0:28:55 well i realli want to talk to my mom about it i want to see what her plan are for me will she like will she motiv me or will she motiv me in what is she hop for from me and stuff like that but the food log i can hang it up everi day look what i ate this day and see if i can do better the next day
311 c: well so you mention someth that is import to you is have the food log hang up where you can track of it use it as a tool
301 c: after i talk to you and after you and i have discuss what you might do and how you plan to do it i'm also go to talk with your mom and come up with exact what you said how can she support you
