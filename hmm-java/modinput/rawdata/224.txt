103 t: like i'll be think like i should slow up the eat but then like when we order pizza i'll be like okay this is pizza i'm readi to eat and then i'm think like you know go back and i'm like there pizza right there so i just be eat
326 c: so in your mind you'r say okay you know i'm go to stop eat as much cut down a littl bit still eat the food that i'm enjoy but not as much and then when it in front of you it pretti hard to do
119 t: yeah so my mama been she had a dietitian too to go to but i don't think she go to it anymor but yeah she her weight come down her been come down but mine been go up laugh becaus she was like i think like 300-someth but she start come down at first she was like knock off inch and then she start knock off the pound
311 c: so there been some success with your mom go and you'r kind of watch her success and what she been do and you'r feel like huh becaus you'r see some result with that
106 t: but i think that i will knock off the pound
311 c: you want to knock off some you'r feel this might be the right time for you to to make some chang
112 t: yep and then my doctor at the clinic that i go to they said that-oh i forgot what i was about to say laugh but she said that like if you got problem like some peopl say they the peopl that are that ask the peopl do they want to join the inaud project ? i said yeah but some of the peopl said that the onli reason they'r gain pound is becaus they'r stress and stuff like that but noth get me stress i'm alway happi so i don't know i just start eat like food like a lot so that probabl whi
314 c: alright so unlik other peopl who are kind of say that it not realli their their fault mayb there other stuff go on you'r realli say that for you it the eat thing you know your mood doesn't get affect and that not whi you eat but it just that you'r eat a lot
102 t: yeah but i see that sometim when i see cake or someth i'll be like there cake right there i want some and i just eat and then eat and sometim i'll be full and i get hungri i go eat and eat i'll be like i need to slow down
311 c: so you can notic while you'r do it that mayb you should slow down some on that
117 t: yeah
326 c: when the food is in front of you it make it a littl bit tougher to do
331 c: so what are some idea that you have for how to slow down when food are right there ?
106 t: like like i was think like when i when we have dinner like don't get as much and have a glass of water so when you eat your food and drink a glass of water you get full right there you don't have to eat a whole lot and then i was go to start go to the center that they told me i can start work out and stuff i was go to go there and aerob at the pool i'v been go there like last year i was go there and then i had stop when it got to winter time and then i start go like i went like last week i went to the pool area with my friend and then after that i haven't went back and have i told myself that i was go to stop eat cake and stuff as usual becaus if i see cake i'm want it so i told myself i was go to calm down on that
328 c: alright so you'v actual had a lot of idea you'v been think about this even befor come in here on way that would work for you to to work on get some of the weight off the pound yeah and one of them be to take you know smaller portion and drink water with your meal that you can go do and like the water aerob and stuff and then the other one would be figur out when there stuff right there like cake and pizza it kind of hmm this look realli good how to how to slow down on those food
112 t: yeah becaus that was like last year i wasn't as big i was in cheerlead and she said if you don't want to get you know way too big you can cut down on some of the portion of your food and your water and it get you full we had stop cheerlead becaus our cheerlead coach had had a babi and then we didn't have anoth coach to teach us
307 c: oh kind of a bummer becaus you found someth that was realli fun and now you can't do it anymor disappoint
119 t: i don't know if they got it back though
311 c: so you'r just kind of think that you know mayb that is someth that could be still around
112 t: becaus in our high school there cheerlead there but it not realli my thing at school and then we got fit and our gym class and stuff like that like everi day we have to do someth like we either go outsid and play basketbal or we play soccer on the field and footbal and stuff like that
311 c: alright so you have some stuff at school that you'r do
117 t: yeah
313 c: but you know when school start back up but for the moment right now you'r kind of tri to figur out what you want to do to to work on the weight now
117 t: yeah
308 c: alright well you know you kind of list off all those nice thing you know address both side of weight loss the nutrit part and the exercis part
117 t: yep
313 c: it sound like you know you'v kind of been watch your mom and you'v been do some stuff too what if ani of those would you realli want to focus on ?
305 c: what if ani of those would you realli want to focus on ?
112 t: realli i want to exercis more that someth that i know that i can improv on but it just that i be lazi so i'm realli not do it even my mama say she'll be like when she tell me like "go outsid and get some fresh air" i just be on the couch like "no i'm okay" laugh i just be lazi and then my friend come over and we'r alway at my hous either on a game or on the comput facebook and stuff like that so basic i'm alway in the hous sometim or unless we go to the movi or we either go bowl or skate
311 c: alright so you'r notic that that be more activ might be someth that you want to do and current you'r do a lot of thing like that are more sedentari activ like the tv and the game and the comput and that might be anoth way for you to work on your weight would be to cut down on the sit so much
106 t: yeah and then like today i'm suppos to go skate and it realli just like you just around the whole the skate rink is so big so we just go around the whole thing basic i'll do some sit down skate but basic i'm up i'm start not to be lazi and stuff like that
313 c: yeah so you'v got some you'v found some stuff that you like to do and actual when you go do them unlik some other peopl that go it sound like you'r up and realli move around and not kind of like sit and chit chat and you know hang out like that
106 t: yeah and then sometim me and my friend we go walk around the block or go to the park and stuff like that
313 c: so you'r do again stuff that activ now but in your head it doe sound like it you know that the exercis thing do a littl bit more is kind of where you'r move toward a bit
106 t: yeah and i told her i said that i was go to cut down on the greasi stuff like fri chicken and hamburg i haven't had none of that in a while
313 c: you know so you'r also make some food chang and it been stick pretti well becaus you'v been abl to do it for a pretti you know a littl bit of time well tell me when you becaus you mention that you haven't realli had like the greasi food like the fri chicken and thing and it been work for a littl while
117 t: uh-huh
333 c: how were you abl to to not eat those food ?
103 t: well some like realli when i eat i realli don't eat becaus i was like i don't like eat realli but it like when i gain the pound is when i eat cake when i eat junk all the time so basic that how i got my pound but i realli don't like eat like food like chicken and sandwich i don't like i don't like sandwich at all it like i don't eat as much as y'al like peopl think i do it just that i eat the junk food that what made me gain my pound i don't like eat as much but i eat a lot when i see junk food like cake and honey bun and stuff like that but like the food like you know bake bean and chicken and a piec of bread i don't eat like that
314 c: so you'r abl to stay away from these other food becaus they'r not realli someth that you enjoy to eat but you kind of keep come back and repeat that you realli notic when you eat the sweet and the cake your weight went up quit a bit
112 t: yeah becaus i'll be like when i inaud i was like 125 like last year probabl and then like this year it just went up and i was like well i'v gain some pound and my doctor had told me that i should join the communiti project and inaud
328 c: so you were readi to do someth becaus you saw the number chang and you weren't so happi about that
117 t: yeah
302 c: yeah and you realli are mention a lot with the the cake and the cooki and and how much you kind of see that relat to your weight and i don't know for you know for some peopl they they want to make some chang in their eat like you know cut down on thing and watch portion size and other peopl even you know they even though they know that this is caus their weight gain it not someth that they'r readi to to work on
305 c: i don't know where you kind of fall in term of the eat stuff
115 t: i want to like lose the weight but it like if it in front of me i'll be like yeah i want that but then i'll be like well i'm realli not go to eat it becaus i'm go to get this off so that basic what i tri to do
313 c: you'r alreadi make an effort to to work on that part where when you see it you don't eat so much of it
117 t: yeah
326 c: and and that where there kind of a difficult part for you
313 c: alright so you'r kind of say like number one you'r remind yourself that you are tri to lose weight number two have just a littl piec and then get out of there get away from the food go see your friend inaud
112 t: inaud if it in my face i'll be like oh i'm go to eat it but then if i just like take a littl piec off be like well i'm go to have to go outsid
308 c: alright so realli two great way to kind of get past that if that what you want to do
117 t: yeah
333 c: what are some other thing you could do ?
106 t: probabl like if i see it i probabl don't want it as much as i do now becaus like usual i be like snap cake right there i'm go to eat it but now i just be like uh there cake right there mayb i'll just get a littl piec and go outsid but i don't like cake it right there becaus like my aunti she real real like real skinni like real boni and she keep cake in her hous and i'll go over to her hous and i usual don't eat the cake now usual i'll be like snap cake right there laugh let me eat it but usual i don't eat it now
313 c: so you'r notic a differ that you'r you are actual kind of refus the cake you don't have to eat it all the time
117 t: yeah
331 c: you'r abl to to kind of move past it if you-how are you abl how are you abl to do that when you'r over there and it
106 t: i just be like there cake right there and then take my like her hous is right here there a park like right across the street from her so i usual take the kid over there and they play i just play with them like i see the cake and be like i want it but i'm not go to do it
308 c: so you'r work realli hard to get yourself away from these thing
117 t: yeah
331 c: yeah that realli someth to hear how much you'r will to kind of like take your cousin out play with them somewher els or go over to your friend just so you don't have to have it there what are some thing that she could do to kind of help you when you know either with you know with that whole idea if you'r tri to cut down with the sweet and the cake ?
112 t: she probabl will go she'll go to the groceri shop and she probabl will cut down of get the cooki and the sweet becaus i got some littl sister and brother and they like sweet so i know that she will probabl cut down just a littl and then she probabl will bring some more healthier stuff in the hous like veget and we got that it just didn't like some of the veget i don't eat like they'r not realli tast good to me so she probabl will bring some more healthier stuff in like salad and stuff like that
311 c: okay so there there are some peopl in your famili that she would still be buy the cake and the cooki for but there could be you know less that she buy
305 c: so when you say that she would do this kind of stuff it sound like that is actual someth that you would like her to do a littl bit more of yeah it might kind of for you you'd feel like you'd have a littl bit less pressur if it wasn't in the hous
106 t: yeah becaus like the snack stay in like one cabinet and the rest is like veget are in the cabinet and stuff like that but i know if i see it i'll probabl want like a piec of it but now it not like that i'm where i see it and be like oh that right there and and mayb i'll be like i might take a littl piec and i think like don't just get out of there
311 c: so it realli is that there are way that if you don't see it it help
117 t: yeah
310 c: and then a lot of it realli fall on you to be strong and to kind of get out of the room and not have ani of it
