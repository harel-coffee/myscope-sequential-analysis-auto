313 c: okay so the two big thing you realli want to focus on are the fri and cut back on those and also the fast food and you realli are think mayb like less than three time a week mayb onc or twice a week would be a good way for you to cut back on some of the calori from that
106 t: not back to back like one day and inaud one day =
314 c: okay kind of spread it out
106 t: and eat more veget
117 t: yeah

119 t: you say how would i do that ?
330 c: mm-hmm
106 t: tri to eat more and inaud i don't know
310 c: so you could eat more is as you know so it interest that you'v definit play that whole that you know that there are certain veget that you don't like and that you do like and just by a matter of eat more of the one you do like you'd be up your veget intak without have to forc yourself to eat thing you didn't like to eat laugh
328 c: but other than kind of eat more of those you'r not realli quit sure what els you could do well i mean you'v mention again a coupl as you know the fri food you'v mention the fast food and you'v mention the veget as thing that realli you know if you'r think of make nutrit chang what you'd like to do
302 c: and a lot of time when i work with peopl you know i kind of just have them focus on one that they think as or two thing it up to them that they think they'r readi like to realli focus on you know
305 c: what do you think would you realli like to focus on ?

313 c: okay so number one chang to eat bake and number two to talk to your mom about how she make the food
117 t: yeah
305 c: okay and i should write it talk to her about bake instead of fri ?
117 t: mm-hmm
306 c: anyth els there ?
313 c: you'r realli focus on this idea of you know make the chang out with the fri
331 c: so whi whi do you want to do this chang ?
112 t: becaus fri food is not healthi can get high blood pressur problem and diabet problem
331 c: what els ?
112 t: to keep my weight down
302 c: all right cool all right so the next part realli talk about this idea that sometim there are thing that get in the way of our plan
344 c: so what are some thing that you know might kind of stop you from lower the fri food that you'r eat ?
109 t: my momma might still fri the chicken
344 c: okay so that what as okay what els ?
109 t: like if i go to my daddi hous they might buy fri chicken from the fast food inaud
326 c: all right so how should i write that just you know there might be fri food at your dad hous
109 t: or at school too
326 c: those are the two big one
308 c: you'r kind of as you know you'r realli think about like kind of all your as all the place you could go
333 c: so it actual realli impress that you'r not think like just at home or just at so and so you'r cover all all the place that thing could go so what are some idea that you have if your mom still decid to fri the chicken even after you ask her to bake it ?
105 t: probabl just eat one piec that the onli thing to do inaud
313 c: so eat a littl bit less in the portion size
105 t: less
323 c: so eat as now when i said less you seem to kind of agre with it more would you like me to write down eat less or eat one piec instead of three piec ?
105 t: eat less
313 c: eat less all right so eat less of the food
117 t: mm-hmm
333 c: what els ?
106 t: for school if there fri food i just bring my own lunch
328 c: ooh so wait a minut all right so you'r kind of think that if there are fri food at home or at your dad hous you could just have less of the food like just have one piec and work on that and then otherwis at school pack your own lunch all right
305 c: and what is the first step that you can take in order to reach your goal of lower the fri food ?
106 t: first thing i do is talk to my mom and my father about the fri food in the hous make it less
309 c: so you'r go straight to the big thing right
326 c: you just want to talk them about it and see what they have to say and so you could talk to them about have less fri food and you'r realli not sure what they'r go to say to that yeah that kind of that big unknown
301 c: yeah you know we have some time you know where i do talk to your mom and then we talk togeth at the end of the session would that be someth that you would want to talk to her about togeth ?
117 t: yeah
345 c: what do you think she'll say ?
324 c: no ? laugh
326 c: this is a new as so this is realli kind of someth new that you'r think about do and it sound like it a pretti big chang from how the rest of your famili eat which might make it pretti tough if they'r sit around realli enjoy you know the chicken and thing and you'r eat a littl differ
333 c: so how might that go if you'r over at your dad and they come in with chicken ?
106 t: that a good question inaud find someth to eat besid fri food
313 c: so you'll just tri to get out of there so you'r kind of realli think about how you can help yourself to stay on track with your weight loss goal you know so your number one idea would be just to talk about it right away but you'r not sure what they'r go to do so you have a plan b as well
117 t: uh-huh
302 c: you know i have i have a littl inform about how to kind of decreas the calori in the fri chicken would it be all right if i kind of share it with you ?
117 t: mm-hmm
305 c: and let me know if you'v alreadi heard it
302 c: becaus you know but sometim peopl will take the skin and the bread off of the chicken and that can kind of cut a good amount of the calori
306 c: what do you think of that ?
112 t: good
325 c: so it kind of i mean so to you it kind of make sens that by take that off you'd be get down on the calori but in term of actual go and do that that might not be the choic that you would make
305 c: well i mean that fair like i said it was just a littl piec of inform and you don't have to do anyth with it if you don't want to
313 c: your idea is realli to have just like the one full piec instead of have more of the piec
117 t: mm-hmm
324 c: when i said that you got kind of quiet laugh
329 c: and i think you think it a pretti wacko idea mayb laugh
117 t: mm
313 c: well what you know you'v alreadi realli kind of said that you were interest in talk to your mom and your dad about the fri food and everyth in the hous
302 c: and this last one realli is someth that your mom becaus she the person that here with you could do to help you with your goal
112 t: she can start lower the fri chicken and stuff in the hous
331 c: stuff
112 t: french fri and greas
311 c: all right so she could kind of cut back on certain thing that are around the hous and then it just wouldn't be the onli thing that peopl were eat
302 c: but you know sometim peopl like to say what they would you know like substitut would that be someth that would be help for you ? or you don't think would that be someth that would be help for her like if you were to say like oh instead of do this i'd realli like this kind of stuff
305 c: i don't know i don't know if that would work or not you know your home and what your mom will say and stuff so
112 t: yeah that work
311 c: so that would work
333 c: so what would be some thing that you would suggest as substitut that you'd like to eat ?
112 t: bake food
306 c: all right all right so kind of take a look at your plan here what do you think ?
112 t: good
301 c: that you like it and you know when your mom come in i can either kind of share this actual paper with her or mayb talk to her more about what we talk about or you know i can kind of just not talk to her about this kind of stuff so what would you like ?

117 t: mm-mm laugh
305 c: okay so what would you as how would you like me to kind of bring up this idea that you you'd like to have lower fri food in the hous ?
112 t: just talk about healthi stuff like fri food is not good to eat more healthi bake food than fri food
311 c: okay so kind of just mayb give her some inform about you know the import of weight manag and decreas fri food
117 t: mm-hmm
313 c: all right and then you talk about want to talk to her about you know kind of ask her what she would think about decreas the fri food when we were togeth
