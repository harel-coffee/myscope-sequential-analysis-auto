311 c: okay so the more import thing for you is to make yourself happi right now and so even though sort of as a side effect your parent you know your famili might be happi realli you want to do it for you physic and the emot benefit of lose weight ?
117 t: yes
328 c: yeah well you know you'v mention physic activ and you'v mention nutrit as two area you know that you'v thought about one is about the food choic and one is about just be activ in sport
305 c: and you know which one of those or both of those are area that you actual would like to talk about chang you know today ?
106 t: my exercis like work out with my sport in school i actual do more than just one sport basketbal and yes i do basketbal and after i stop my mom was like "oh your weight shot back up let get you involv with someth else" then she notic like when the off season that when i gain my weight back caus i lose a lot of weight dure the season and then i gain it back in the off season so
310 c: mmm so you'v notic actual quit a bit of weight loss success when you'r activ with sport and the way your bodi type is the minut you stop exercis it like sort of right back up ?
117 t: yeah
310 c: okay and so you know one thought is to continu to tri to find way to exercis even when you'r not in sport the other choic is to cut back on your eat when you'r not be as activ
305 c: so which one of those would you want to talk about today if ani ?
120 t: sorri what the question ?
303 c: either so it sound like becaus you are lose weight when you'r activ with sport and so it seem like you either your choic is to either be activ with sport all the time or to cut your food your calori when you'r not you know when you'r in the off season
112 t: i think i prefer to cut back on the calori more becaus i have a busi schedul outsid of sport and stuff so i think cut back on the calori and stuff would help me out a lot with manag my weight
305 c: okay so rather than come up with an exercis plan everi day you'd rather focus on the cut of the calori right now ? okay alright caus you know we onli have you know today to talk and so you know obvious there lot of differ thing you can do but it go to be you know it seem like focus on one thing that you mayb can accomplish right now might be you know worthwhil for you and you want to look at the cut calori ?
117 t: mm-hmm
331 c: and so let talk about that a littl bit what are your thought about cut calori ?
111 t: i mean i don't mind tri someth new but i don't want to make a big dramat chang right now just stop eat someth yeah
328 c: okay so you this is someth you realli want to do and you realli want to make a chang but you'r worri that this sort of dramat like huge thing is not someth you can accomplish right now and you'v alreadi said you'v tri and tri and tri so mani thing and it doesn't work and mayb you'r on to someth mayb make some small chang might have more success
117 t: yeah i think so
311 c: you think so for you rather than like a big dramat chang kind of some gradual chang ?
117 t: mm-hmm
302 c: alright well i do have some inform here about idea that we could talk about or mayb you have some of your own idea about what you might want to chang
305 c: what would you prefer ?
112 t: some of those
302 c: to take a look ? okay alright so i'm go to leav all this stuff with you caus this is some other exercis idea and stuff but you want to focus on the nutrit so exercis so okay so whi don't we just go through kind of get a bird eye view of all these and then you can see which one or two or if ani you want to mayb think about
117 t: okay
302 c: okay so this one talk about drink and the differ calori that are in drink
331 c: what do you know about how mani calori you'd need to cut in order to lose weight ?
119 t: i'm not exact sure
302 c: okay so one piec of inform that might be help is even to know how much you would need so would you like me to talk to you a littl bit more about that ?
117 t: yes
302 c: okay so a pound of weight is 3500 calori basic that a whole pound so if you were go to lose a pound a week what we do is we basic divid this by seven day so i don't know if math is your best thing but seven divid by 3500 or 3500 divid by seven is 500 calori a day
306 c: so i'll just put that up here okay so what doe that mean to you ?
112 t: i don't think that a lot
302 c: okay so cut 500 calori a day doesn't seem like that much to you right now so let keep that in mind when you kind of take a look at this so here drink ani kind of sugar drink pretti much will be about a hundr calori a drink so i don't know you know that one think to think about the other thing so even like juic you know even fruit juic is 120 calori for a cup so that one area then we talk about fast food and you could see here there lot of thing that have 500 calori even like just a fri chicken sandwich is 800 for exampl so if you cut that out or substitut it with a 300 calori you know sandwich you would like if you substitut well here a garden salad with grill chicken instead of the fri chicken that would be 500 right there or let say you had a grill chicken sandwich instead of fri chicken that would be 300 and then you'd onli need to cut out like a drink or two you know what i'm say ? so let see what els ? and then there the portion size which is you know basic tell you you know how much like portion the differ calori are and to cut your portion so those are some differ area that you could look at
305 c: mayb you have anoth idea in term of the 500 calori ?
117 t: no i don't know
305 c: caus it realli up to you you know i mean a lot of peopl tri to put peopl on diet but that can be pretti drastic and it doesn't fit necessarili with your life so if you think about your you know typic day you could pick someth or mayb you could tell me what you eat in a typic day and we could talk about where might be the best way best place
103 t: well for breakfast i usual kind of skip breakfast caus i'm usual tri to get readi for the day so i'll skip that for lunchtim i might eat a late lunch mayb at one even two o'clock sometim like today i haven't ate anyth caus i was rush to get back home and didn't have a lot of time so yeah
302 c: some kid find that when they skip meal they get realli hungri and then they eat more at the next meal is that someth that happen ?
117 t: yeah yes it is
302 c: okay so anoth possibl is to add like some small meal earli on so that you don't overeat you know at your next meal that anoth thought
333 c: so for 500 a day what are you think about cut ?
110 t: i drink juic but not a lot of it mayb i'm not sure actual 500 i'm not sure what i could cut
330 c: okay
120 t: i'm tri to rememb what
360 c: what you eat ?
117 t: yeah
331 c: yeah how much do you know about the calori in what you'r eat ? is that someth that you'v been pretti educ about or is it someth that you'r not realli sure about ?
109 t: i'm not veri educ with the calori in the differ food that i eat i realli don't know like especi go out fast food eat i realli don't know what the calori are in some of the food
326 c: are right right okay so one of the thing that may get in the way of cut the 500 calori is you don't realli know how much you'r eat in term of calori
117 t: mm-hmm
302 c: okay well some peopl find it help to for awhil to record
305 c: what they eat and how mani calori is in their food to kind of see you know what that look like i'm not sure what you think about that idea if that someth you'd want to do or if you'd rather just pick a coupl of substitut
112 t: i would rather pick substitut
309 c: okay you'r kind of tri to think realist about what go to go on in your life and that realli import
349 c: well you mention substitut juic and i'm not sure do you drink soda pop at all or ?
106 t: not that often as how i use to
313 c: okay so you'v alreadi made some chang in that
349 c: so one is to just be drink water as one possibl you'v mention fast food you know how often would you say that you eat fast food ?
103 t: in a week depend on how the week is probabl onc or twice
343 c: okay and what kind of thing are you eat the rest of the time ?
106 t: when i'm at home and my mom make dinner she probabl make chicken or someth and she usual bake it now she don't usual fri it how much she use to caus it hot outsid summer she may barbecu some chicken chicken and probabl bake bean or someth like that
311 c: mm-hmm what about the it sound like the actual eat out onc or fast food is onli onc or twice a week and when your mom make dinner she cook actual pretti healthi right now ?
117 t: yes
349 c: okay what about sweet and snack and chip and those kind of thing ?
103 t: well she doe buy chip and stuff for us for me and my famili i most eat chip like dure lunchtim i might have a sandwich and some chip and yeah
310 c: okay so that it sound like that might be a potenti place to also cut some calori
306 c: is with the chip what are your thought about that ?
111 t: i mean i don't mind but i would still like to have some
305 c: right caus you alreadi said you don't want to cut anyth out complet
343 c: so what about portion size with those thing ? like so for exampl if it lunchtim and you'r have chip you know do you find that you could eat half a bag of chip like that snap or do you find that you just eat a coupl and stop or you know ?
103 t: with chip i probabl eat like start with two hand not half a bag just i don't a lot
325 c: okay so it sound like you'r not realli still realli not sure you know where would be the best place to cut those calori
110 t: i'm not actual sure where
331 c: what your best guess about where you know where most of your weight come from ?
103 t: not enough activ like i might eat and like sit down get sleepi and i might go to sleep
112 t: i'm think that mayb walk around do some housework or even go outsid would help me
328 c: so it sound like you mayb you know that 500 calori you can cut by cut food but you can also burn by get more activ so what you'r say is mayb it would be better to do like a littl bit of each you know like cut back a littl bit of food like cut out juic or mayb a littl bit smaller portion at dinner but then also be a littl bit more activ at the same time so that you'r burn at the same time but you also don't want to like work out at a gym you want to kind of more just like go outsid for a walk or just mayb or mayb watch less-sit around less is what you'r say ?
117 t: mm-hmm yeah
305 c: okay so what i'm hear is you don't want to make sweep chang but mayb a littl bit of chang in each of these area ?
306 c: did i get that right ?
