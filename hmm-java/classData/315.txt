1	c: yeah both of the things-i mean they'r both the two piec of the puzzl
2	c: okay so read the label more is someth that you'v thought was help mayb you can get back on

6	c: okay so son to walk so mayb when she come back we can talk about a plan a walk plan where they could do a certain amount each day
7	c: so you have your own plan i'll write that down the first step you can do then is to plan you know altern walk schedul so one day you one day him okay
8	c: so it go to be a whole famili thing
9	c: yeah so at famili event you can talk about this stuff and kind of see the chang peopl are make and inform other peopl
10	c: well you know a treat but if you save all the calori dure the meal then you know
11	c: okay okay so so continu with get the whole famili on board and talk about healthi choic and healthi eat is someth you'd like to continu
12	c: oh that fun so a saturday danc night oh okay should i-i'l add that saturday danc night
13	c: so you guy are go togeth
14	c: it sound like a lot of fun it get everyon move
15	c: so you'r happi he take an activ role
16	c: so he on you a littl bit for that too
17	c: so your famili is do some thing and we'v kind of alreadi been work with him on this on this part
18	c: so thing that are kind of more singl serv you can watch portion
19	c: so you are realli kind of keep an eye on thing that are come in the hous and as a famili are make some adjust
20	c: you want to talk about exercis and you mention portion size
21	c: yeah so it also like a cool famili kind of famili thing too
22	c: well and you know it almost sound though that you'r a littl worri that he not get enough if he is miss that middl meal
23	c: so you'r realli work with everybodi to be meet their nutrit and fruit and veggi need
24	c: that balanc right
25	c: like you don't want them to get carri away but
26	c: so all you can do is remind her right ? i mean you can't make her do it right now and but remind her about breakfast and lunch is someth someth she came up with
27	c: so there is kind of that point where you'r kind of wonder all right if they have had one bowl then the grape and a banana you know mayb that enough for today
28	c: so you said drink water smaller portion and help come up with an exercis program
29	c: so you'r kind of concern that just he doesn't want to feel out front that he do someth differ
30	c: fanci so you'r realli like play with recip now
31	c: so you'r kind of chang thing up and he also start to come in and be a littl interest in the cook
32	c: so they have a lot of interest in there so you'r realli feel that becaus they'r interest
33	c: okay so you'r kind of bring stuff in for them and notic that as you'r bring in more stuff they'r get more interest and involv and
34	c: so that not so bad to have a littl help in the kitchen
35	c: okay so you actual think it could make a differ you just
36	c: just get move togeth and
37	c: get up and do it
38	c: right so remind her about breakfast and lunch is someth that you'r will to tri becaus it what she want what she want and mayb it will help with smaller portion in the even if she eat other meal
39	c: you'r concern about the amount or her size at her age
40	c: and along with kind of take the initi to come and do program like this in order to help her there are some other thing that you'r kind of work on too
41	c: so realli recogn that balanc between activ to burn some of it and what the nutrit and what she put in there okay so you mention that there some stuff around get into a gym and then
42	c: and then also what you are buy for for what in the hous
43	c: and so far it go okay
44	c: you don't want weight to add to that and then realli the health thing think about her futur and keep her healthi
45	c: so get the movement in and the more she up and move
46	c: it kind of find that balanc too with as weight come off peopl tend to want to do more
47	c: to help your child period becaus you'v alreadi been do
48	c: so it a togeth thing you guy are both work it out and
49	c: so she she seen some benefit too as far as weight loss with the chang she make
50	c: it a big famili thing
51	c: and so one of the idea that you have is to get her outsid or take her get her to the gym so that she not eat all the time and then so that'll not onli cut down on her inact time
52	c: so it realli kind of the support of her and and have it come from her to to not have you alway have to do everyth alon
53	c: cover all her physic and emot need
54	c: yeah realli start start it off a littl differ in school and she'll have a littl bit more confid yeah so you you know you do have this goal of you know a healthi reason goal of how much weight you'd like her to lose and keep her on track with it is realli your your focus right now
55	c: so be abl to deal with the weight will realli get rid of a lot of ani health issu that you know if ani that that could come up and your kind of famili approach to the eat healthi and the activ be the support environ that you want to
56	c: you'r worri about her
57	c: okay so you want to do this for her to be a well child
58	c: right so so there a coupl of thing you'r worri about you'v got diabet in your famili and you'r worri becaus your mom die from diabet you'r worri becaus you see this up on her neck and you'r worri that she go to start have bodi pain and thing from the weight and then it caus conflict between the two of you becaus you know everi time you go shop or the mall it a problem
59	c: and you also notic that that her weight is much higher than what you thought
60	c: yeah she mention now that you bought a scale so that you can actual keep
61	c: an eye more regular now
62	c: right so you alreadi have a goal it sound like that you want her to start monitor her weight more
63	c: so you'r worri about her self esteem and it go to be this conflict
64	c: and if you monitor the weight you can see
65	c: so we have to come up with a plan to continu these posit chang
66	c: okay so one thing you know it sound like you could do is see in the if she lose weight in the next two week that might prove to her that the activ is help and you guy can figur out a way to continu it</text
67	c: so you'v got lot of stuff you'r tri to do
68	c: you know the idea that she has this goal you have thought about how it you know you'v got all this equip for her and all this stuff and you have your other daughter who will to help her
69	c: well and you know again to be optimist if she doe make some chang hope the stuff you buy now won't fit anyway later becaus she'll lose some weight
70	c: and what happen so you have alreadi switch to bake
71	c: so you alreadi say there no fri food in the hous
72	c: so right now you see exercis is go to be the toughest one to do but these other thing about the water and those you think will be pretti easi
73	c: okay but there possibl that she made some chang in the last two week so hope with the weight monitor you know that would be
74	c: it sound like mayb that realli your goal is to start monitor her weight becaus everyth els you'v alreadi been do
75	c: get you want her to get the weight down becaus of you said diabet
76	c: right becaus you'r worri about diabet ?
77	c: okay you'r go to do it as a set time
78	c: set time and so it part of what she has to do everi day
79	c: just like a kid who has to take medic you got to do it everi day it just the way it is
80	c: alright you'v alreadi bought the scale and and your first step is go to be
81	c: to set the time
82	c: so you have concern about her eat
83	c: so you'd like to see it her her to lose some weight
84	c: so if she see you do a bit of it more
85	c: and realli were think okay you know if we were go to have breakfast i'v got stuff in the hous to eat</text
86	c: so you'r put in a lot of the stuff into action that you kind of read and and know about
87	c: mm-hmm so it it doe sound like you'r kind of look for what what to do next
88	c: and again she realli target with the fri food someth that
89	c: yeah so it sound like you see the benefit of some of these small step even though you have some larger goal with the activ that i absolut encourag you to take step on small and larg step so you don't see anyth get in the way of the small thing
90	c: so that idea of you kind of take the lead set the you know
91	c: so you'r realli think about take this on in term of chang
92	c: so find that the the push the oomph
93	c: so you know just tri to keep her healthi and open and
94	c: so healthi healthi weight loss
95	c: so you know appear you'd like to see her lose some weight
96	c: and you have talk to her a littl bit about it
97	c: so realli kind of manag what go on with the famili and how you'r you know food budget and thing like that when
98	c: so when it realli interact with like the rest of the famili and what they want to eat then you'll say some thing but otherwis
99	c: all right and that work but when it doesn't happen that when you say stuff and
100	c: so you'r not say like go do this go sign up for that
101	c: and it may be that that sort of the idea is where can you make the most impact right now you'r put a lot of energi into the exercis with mayb not a lot of payoff but you'r say you can put the energi into the other two and mayb you'll get more payoff
102	c: but if they'r go out and do it you'r realli support
103	c: yeah drive him around that mom taxi isn't it laugh
104	c: so as a famili you are get out sometim to do thing
105	c: and you'r realli will to do all these thing you'r just a littl worri that you'd like to see it be more intens or more movement
106	c: so the other kid are realli kind of more proactiv in what they'r do and then they'll kind of just be like "mom i'm do this" and so then you'r okay how do we do it and you'll drive around and you'll do the stuff with it
107	c: you'd like to see some more thing that were more activ
108	c: all right so it sound like you'r pretti commit to all the step
109	c: so you'd like to see her find an activ outsid that isn't sleep that-and you'd be onboard if someth like that came around
110	c: so if you'r go to chase after these kid like that
111	c: run laugh yeah so you'r pretti activ with that but if she kind of came and said someth
112	c: this idea that if it activ and all right so it almost it like find that find someth that not food relat for her to do to kind of get her out more and do
113	c: to kind of work on that but you'r realli think that find stuff to do outsid the hous get her not sleep as much would be the thing to work on
114	c: so she realli is ask for healthi thing so
115	c: so there again stuff around the hous and the food thing but you realli do think the activ is the one to focus on
116	c: so kind of as you have experienc you realli just want him to kind of be as activ as he can and
117	c: you'r be sensit to that idea of what other peopl say you don't want to have him worri about that at all so you'r realli think about him in the now be healthi and kind of mental and physic so lose a littl bit of weight would benefit him in a lot of way
118	c: well you'r not look for skinni you'r look for healthi yeah i mean you know and realli kind of look at how the famili is but still watch ani of the thing that might happen for his health like the you mention the diabet and thing so in your mind you know lose some weight would be a realli posit thing for him now and for the futur
119	c: mm-hmm so you'r realli kind of work with him to have him understand what the reason for make chang are instead of just kind of be overbear and tell him about these thing and there been realli posit result as a result of that becaus he lose some of the weight
120	c: yeah and it and it sound like he realli alreadi has made that
121	c: yeah so you'r realli tri to build his i guess you know healthi choic with thing around
122	c: so it alway like a posit kind of goal thing
123	c: yeah so have some beverag that tast that way that doesn't have the calori as a you know as a substitut everi onc in a while
124	c: so again you know this activ piec is he realli cover well now with the day camp you have him in and the fact that he can get to footbal practic almost everi day laugh and the movement you guy as a famili might be make toward activ thing
125	c: so the fact that he said veggi ad in some veggi is is a posit thing
126	c: and you are make sure that he has it and are help kind of teach him how to watch the portion on it by measur thing alreadi
127	c: look at the drink okay
128	c: so realli you don't want to touch that the famili fun of go out onc onc a month and have that togeth it realli a great thing for all of you but you'r think the the day to day super or fast food type thing might be someth you could cut back on a littl bit
129	c: oh no no i kind of inaud there so you mention the you know the veget you mention cut back on go to fast food
130	c: so alreadi as a famili you guy are make posit choic and i notic again you'r say that he make the choic so he you know you'v kind of given him that
131	c: yeah so you'r kind of give him some control option
132	c: and he realli run with it
133	c: but if they don't-sometim like you say if they don't rememb you can you can put drink in the fridg you know water in the fridg you know
134	c: and she had some side effect now about the weight that realli was eye open and you notic that you made some chang and then it was kind of slip back into how it was befor
135	c: so you'v tri a coupl differ thing
136	c: you mention someth sort of slip now that you are hope to get back to
137	c: okay so figur out better way to plan so that you have someth quick you can do when you get home
138	c: okay so for you weekend activ might make the most sens right now ?
139	c: and if you add two day a week of exercis you know that someth
140	c: activ on weekend okay so meal plan and be activ on the weekend are two sort of veri specif goal
141	c: okay so improv everyon health is realli import
142	c: right right so you'r tri to bring in more healthi food into the hous
143	c: okay so son and daughter do some cook or prepar ?
144	c: okay so it sound like you guy need a sort of a schedul of meal for the week that you do and they do and that everyon chip in for
145	c: so sunday might be a good meal plan day and if you miss your shop that day you can make due until you get shop okay so it sound like a sunday meal plan with everybodi togeth you know like a famili meet to plan the meal might be i mean that was i think an idea you'v come up with that could be a veri specif thing to tri
146	c: caus they'r 16 and
147	c: and 14 so they can do prepar
148	c: well and if you'r plan you know two day a week of someth and if one get cancel at least you'v got one day a week
149	c: so like you mean start someth today like the meal plan today
150	c: okay so today have the famili meet where you do some meal plan and some activ plan
151	c: and then she if she'll do you know her part
152	c: you have the knowledg in there and you keep the hous stock with healthi thing
153	c: right yeah so so you you realli want this for her
154	c: and you know it need to happen
155	c: so kind of work on the portion size and moder thing
156	c: you want her to be healthi and happi and you see that the weight is make her unhappi and unhealthi
157	c: oh okay so you'v actual not onli are you realli concern about her and want to do someth for her but you'r also see that if you make the chang with her that you'll help both of you
158	c: both of you
159	c: so realli focus our time on the activ piec would be the most help
160	c: okay so so there there been a lot of concern you know wednesday you had this wake up call
161	c: she encourag you
162	c: it someth she realli want to do
163	c: you have that kind of stuff
164	c: and she realli doe
165	c: so spend more time read the menu and the calori
166	c: she could not bring home food
167	c: so it find someth then that she can do that won't have the arthriti flare up again but still get her out and move so you'v seen posit result with the activ
168	c: you want her to be healthi and happi
169	c: so it not about a number but it realli about like how you'r feel and how you'r abl to move and those kind of thing
170	c: yeah so you alreadi have one step in the right direct which is
171	c: some kid don't so you'r alreadi like ahead of the game
172	c: you know you'r just do a coupl thing so the first step you'r go to do is when you go to mcdonald today and again we'r not even say don't go to mcdonald
173	c: becaus you know you'r hungri you'r on your way out the door you'r drive right by but you'r go to do someth differ this time when you go
174	c: and she tell you what some thing she want carrot for exampl
175	c: and you so you mention that you guy were do some walk some of the time and that was kind of a posit thing for her
176	c: you feel pretti hope
177	c: okay and you'v realli had sort of this you know wakeup call that you want to realli get this is the time for you right now
178	c: so you'r famili is realli address both side of weight loss
179	c: they move i have seen them in action
180	c: alright so you'r take a lot of effort in term of it a littl uncomfort have you know set a new rule that he need to come and talk to you about it but you'r will to put that in becaus you want to work on that prevent
181	c: okay yeah and he do okay with it ?
182	c: okay so he start to actual realli respond
183	c: and it also sound like it kind of cut down on food cost when
184	c: and you'r realli think outsid of just the home too what can he get to in his environ and
185	c: and i can see that your long term goal is to get some of the weight off of him
186	c: so that was kind of a posit that here she join this group that
187	c: and even though as a famili you'r realli go for this togeth by make chang you'r not just make chang for him
188	c: and have also realli look at this in the long term if you'v been work on this stuff for a year you know
189	c: so you'r kind of look for the like what could be the next step
190	c: okay so bring him into the convers and think about you know fill out some kind of a plan on what one thing you'd like to work on
191	c: is base on a lot of activ there
192	c: okay so you'r you don't need ani convinc about that ?
193	c: and you'r realiz that you know this activ has to be someth she doe she can't reli on you
194	c: and it almost sound like that's-you said it a step kind of that you'd like to see a littl bit more
195	c: so you'v alreadi you know in this last week decid to make some chang around your food and when you went shop last week you did it differ
196	c: you'v alreadi express concern
197	c: and even though your resourc are limit right now you'r find a way to make that happen
198	c: you'r all water
199	c: and not bring it into the hous
200	c: yeah so you can check those thing caus if she eat lot of bake chip
201	c: yeah but if she doesn't like it as much and eat less then it might be better
202	c: you know the hammertim
203	c: okay so you'r not go to bring it in the hous no matter what if you get the crave you'll find anoth time or place to do it
204	c: so you want to find other activ
205	c: so it both for yourself and for the whole famili
206	c: right she need to do it independ of you
207	c: so tri to find someth that keep you realli not bore and fun and danc is someth that you brought up as a way to-you know that you'v seen in the past kept you slim that also someth you'r do now
208	c: so it kind of a famili thing
209	c: so sometim you cook meal and you alway includ a veget
210	c: so you'r you'r sound like this is kind of someth you'v been think about for a littl bit you sound kind of resolv in that
211	c: okay so kind of dial down the the fast food a littl bit
212	c: a whole lot
213	c: so pick up a littl bit the amount of time that you'r do the danc
214	c: so you actual realli came in here with this idea to show her that you'r support her plan of weight loss
215	c: what could be of help for her can we kind of take idea that are help
216	c: it take effort
217	c: yeah so get past that time barrier and the conveni of
218	c: so it find that the addit time or work in the addit time to prepar stuff
219	c: with the you know have the snack there
220	c: tide them over it got them home but what is it that you know how can you balanc it in there and how do you fit and you'r you'r think of a few way
221	c: so it kind of goe back to that you know you take a lot of that respons to set everybodi up in their healthi habit and they kind of fall into it from there
222	c: so it the action part and how to make it work for your famili
223	c: so the one half of the equat is for like what you'r put into your bodi you feel realli confid and motiv about do
224	c: alright so you'r notic that she she pretti not veri activ and that is someth that you would like to see her improv
225	c: and you this is someth that you have kind of work with her on befor you'v been tri to get her out and activ
226	c: and you see that as realli a great way for her to get her weight you know to lose some weight
227	c: alright as oppos to just stay at the hous and
228	c: yeah and then the other side of what is come out what you'r burn is one piec that you possibl could work on and
229	c: alright so not to say anyth against her but you'r just kind of notic that that anoth thing that ad to her weight is the quantiti of food that she take in and you'r not quit sure how to
230	c: so compar to the weight in your famili she is not as larg but you do you are notic that she is still in need of some weight loss
231	c: okay so in term of kind of the the where and the healthi place to kind of watch where the weight is for your you know overal health okay and oh go ahead
232	c: becaus you'r make some healthi chang as a famili the way you'r cook thing and you'r bring veget you know you'r not a famili that doesn't eat veget and you'r not a famili that goe to fast food everi day
233	c: you know that you could kind of take it to the next level and work at the weight loss
234	c: so there are certain food that you keep out of the hous you you don't bring cooki into the hous or other sweet like that you'r realli work on kind of
235	c: and and are realli will to support them and to keep them kind of in that mindset of they'r veri strong and beauti women and at the same time want their health to be good
236	c: so are will to kind of make some chang around there
237	c: so you'r realli say that you know just cut it back to the one glass a day would be take out a signific a a larg portion of calori
238	c: so she make some step and push toward it
239	c: kind of the gradual down step but it sound like you'r pretti familiar with the actual number of how mani calori are in differ amount of thing and so look at at that kind of inform like what it would it equat to in term of like weight over the long term might not be veri use to you becaus you'r alreadi familiar with it
240	c: okay and you'r feel actual you know pretti good about that one
241	c: you'r feel good comfort and confid about that
242	c: okay yeah so you'r say that there are other flavor beverag that don't have calori in them that you can easili sub in and it wouldn't be a problem
243	c: so it central in your mind you came in here you made this appoint and also how do we you know how do you get nicki involv with some of this
244	c: and again the focus on the the exercis be an import piec
245	c: yeah and you'r realli kind of talk about you know health now and work with the weight for the famili
246	c: so you found someth kind of not relat to the activ like you said you kind of had it-it was someth fun but it wasn't focus on
247	c: mm-hmm so she is realli kind of emot respond to this she doesn't want to go shop as much it bring her down and
248	c: mm-hmm so you actual notic that your weight has increas and you'r kind of stay that way even though you don't want to becaus you'r tri to support her and she
249	c: so you have the mall as one possibl walk to the librari
250	c: mm-hmm yeah yeah becaus if she over there by herself and you'r shop on the other side of the store it even bigger of a deal
251	c: okay so you'r will to kind of do that stuff to make her feel more comfort
252	c: okay so she realli miss a lot of the social part of it
253	c: mm-hmm and she actual kind of come up with a number like under 200
254	c: and you guy have talk about you know she say like someth got to have to start now like this is someth that we'r go to get done
255	c: so you'r abl to kind of like find the time that comfort with who is there and who is not and
256	c: okay so kind of it again like there not just one person that onli work on it a lot of peopl around
257	c: so and it like it like that due time
258	c: yeah i mean the you know so your famili is realli at that point where you came in here to meet with us and
259	c: and age-wis she elig so we don't have to worri about that stuff okay well good alright so so the gym be one of the option there and also kind of look in the futur with other program that might be around
260	c: okay so you'r look for way to find the fun and you know you mention the walk as be a realli good one for your famili and also this idea of the danc
261	c: yeah i mean you have to keep your relationship
262	c: so she has a lot of resourc and thing that she can kind of pick and choos from
263	c: alright so she work within that she make it work for her
264	c: yeah so you'v got to be reason with it too
265	c: so she veri realli control it well
266	c: so a veri excit kind of goal is for her to get off the shot
267	c: like a gradual kind of chang over
268	c: slowli bring it in so that it not this big shock for everybodi and
269	c: so you'v got some definit veri concret thing in mind
270	c: so it that both side of the equat and
271	c: mm-hmm so she listen it just how she want to go about it yeah she got her person
272	c: so you'r kind of interest in what she and i had to talk about and
273	c: so you have to tipto veri care
274	c: so it find that activ that she want to do a littl bit more or frequent know that you'r just go to have to chang up
275	c: alright so you'r interest in the thing that she had to say how she want to go and approach that
276	c: the support and the this and the that kind of thing
277	c: you know i i have to say you know i work with a lot of teen and a lot of time they won't say like i want to have my mom help me with do this and that laugh so it sound like you have given her a lot of support with keep thing in the hous and those type of food thing
278	c: so activ is anoth piec of this
279	c: yeah so there a lot on your a lot of time on your part to get with the cowork get the kid organ
280	c: so hear it a littl bit from me and kind of with you know the other peopl here
281	c: laugh so she'll keep she'll keep us on our toe
282	c: oh the calori pack mm-hmm
283	c: laugh so kind of you know stick with her you know get her out and about dure the day and thing like that if it possibl so
284	c: but you are feel realli support and
285	c: yeah becaus you'r kind of go with that idea that i mean a lot of the veget are lower in calori and thing like celeri and carrot stick yeah the quantiti is there but the fruit calori
286	c: okay so she has the healthi snack for there
287	c: so you'v tri quit a few thing
288	c: you want inform
289	c: so it becom an issu in term of his behavior becaus you'r see some sneak and lie now around the food
290	c: right so do you so what i'm hear you say is it got to be dad who go to take thing away or give him thing for the walk and the run and the treadmil
291	c: so be reason becaus you know like in your famili and yourself thing that kind of-you get bore do the same thing over and over again too and so you'r not go to expect them to do crazi long time of anyth and the march band is a new thing that kind of
292	c: okay so one possibl is to ask is to talk to dad about stop the fast food and have mayb healthi food that he could bring to work with him
293	c: so you'r feel like you can mayb take some power back now that your oldest son is home
294	c: so kind of keep our finger cross there and i mean you guy have done a lot of research you look on the internet you talk to a lot of-i mean you'v done a lot on your end to find differ thing
295	c: he want to do it okay
296	c: right so so it sound like you have a pretti good plan in mind which is to start bring him home with you more
297	c: yeah but for the health of your son you'r say that you'r go to make this chang no matter what becaus you'r worri about him
298	c: work all the time on stay activ and
299	c: so you buy some healthi thing
300	c: okay so one thing we can do is mayb see if we can get him to commit to go home too and that might help
301	c: you realli want the healthi rout
302	c: so it also find like posit way for him to be with his dad and not just the negat way
303	c: you need the strength to step up and get him home with you in the even and that would realli make a differ
304	c: oh i couldn't even do that yeah
305	c: it up to him okay
306	c: it doe have a lot of thing in it doesn't it ?
307	c: it veri import isn't it
308	c: it doesn't make thing quit yeah but quit right doe it ?
309	c: and i would imagin that your daughter probabl has the same experi
310	c: so you see the benefit of work togeth and
311	c: yeah you'r realli feel comfort yeah so that
312	c: you know you say that chang and make chang make less junk food avail for exampl was one thing you mention earlier yeah and it it can be help and support yeah
313	c: it is a start
314	c: if i as i'm listen to you it seem that you'r readi to just jump off right now and get start and
315	c: so you feel like you could start at a start point
316	c: all right so where we kind of have the big thing be that you know she look for an exampl it also has to be someth that you like to do and you'r think veri reason that it gotta be the right activ
317	c: she did a veri good job that that right well mayb we could use her plan as a guid and think about you know as a plan for for how you might support her and then you know you put it sound as though you'r you'll go home and make a plan for yourself as well
318	c: it seem like you see lead by exampl as the
319	c: 31:16 so you can see the long term benefit that you see for her save her from have to work on this later in life
320	c: so you do realli feel that she would respond if she saw you do it and could do it with you like the walk you guy were walk togeth to the librari
321	c: she it sound like she a veri import person to you
322	c: so you'r do some research on your own
323	c: all right so it sound like you already-you'r pretti deadset on do it it a matter of figur out how
324	c: so you see her do vigor activ at home as be better than be out where you'r too far away to do someth if anoth
325	c: that kind of make sens given that if her knee would go out of joint that doesn't realli put pressur on her knee
326	c: and the one thing that i heard you say is "if i could just find the right thing to do exercise-wise"
327	c: so you'r look to kind of increas the intens when you'r walk but also keep that balanc of
328	c: the posit thing i hear though is that you just start this this summer and you haven't gotten discourag and you recogn that it a learn process some day are go to be better than other day and as you learn more over time you'll figur out more effect thing to do you know i mean i think that that a realli great start you know definit
329	c: sound like that might be right around the corner then where he may make some chang too
330	c: so you see and also i hear you say you see sever differ way you could use the food log it not onli just as a marker of what she been eat but also you see it as a tool for help you to
331	c: you don't like to sweat you don't-i mean not-peopl don't like to sweat peopl don't like to alway do that so kind of fill it in with where it hit for you
332	c: so this might be less help for the kid but mayb more help sinc everybodi would be keep a food log it might be help for the adult in the famili too
333	c: so you see that it realli import to do the three smaller meal per day
334	c: but the famili walk is one option
335	c: that a progress yeah it sound like a work in progress that you recogn is import but
336	c: yeah substitut sound like a realli import
337	c: so a sweet littl note that kind of a prompt about you know what a healthi choic you could make today kind of okay i hear that that kind of the primari messag
338	c: right becaus you'r kind of recogn it her-it in her court right now
339	c: that a realli import place to be in right it sound like becaus that give you some right you know the power to say okay now i'm gonna need to make some chang
340	c: yeah it sound as though you'v notic that right she just not quit readi to take over right do some of these but on the other hand that doe seem pretti reason given her age too
341	c: so overal i mean i think the under messag that you'v been give me is that you want her to take some part in this to take some respons right and i wonder if you know given that there are mani mani differ thing to it sound like you know how to do if mayb that a way to bring her in is have her start help to make healthi choic and identifi what they would be so that she doe have some respons
342	c: so they do stay pretti involv and activ throughout the day
343	c: okay so it sound like you'r realli help to put some knowledg in place for her
344	c: okay so realli it you'r readi to help her do whatev it is she want to
345	c: you make the make it make it yourself
346	c: you realli tri to get some inaud
347	c: so kind of that all of these reason kind of have to lead in to find some activ eventu and stick to someth
348	c: and i mean the suggest that you made is you well is one hour out of the day right realli gonna break the day so that it no longer off time ?
349	c: get up and be activ
350	c: it just not for you
351	c: so you'v in your own way have alreadi been reward by encourag her to tri new thing
352	c: you don't make egg separ
353	c: so you'd like to see ultim your goal is for her to be part of the initi
354	c: either okay so you'r realli make an effort in term of what in the home
355	c: so you'r realli will to kind of help her with this plan and come up with the plan for her might be the
356	c: so there is mayb some specif thing that you might be abl to do to support her in the chang
357	c: mm-hmm so let see so you'r choos to help doing-with her portion control and meal
358	c: so it sound like you'r realli get the idea that this is import to you becaus you know that she still need some guidanc right and some help okay
359	c: it will be a big differ right
360	c: so you'r kinda alway we'r alway you know you alway have your eye on them right we'r alway realli noth could prevent you
361	c: so you'v got a coupl thing it sound like these are some strategi that have been pretti success for you
362	c: seem like a-it a lot about make reason choic
363	c: you mention a lot about the self imag and just kind of be healthi about the way she do thing
364	c: it seem like she just base on look at her plan that if you were to sit down and chat with her about these thing that it realli could be kind of a team teamwork kind of inaud
365	c: so you have sever differ kind of motiv to sort of inaud
366	c: it seem like that a good direct for you to
367	c: it sound like this is what you'r live for right now to do this and you mention some health reason whi it would be import for both you and him to continu do these thing
368	c: okay so first it this idea of can she do it on her own at all like even transport all those those kind of thing and then it the second part of will she
369	c: well mayb this is an area where he could get the opportun to do some of the footbal kind of thing
370	c: but it sound like sinc you know what his limit are you'd have to help him set up some pretti clear boundari so he doesn't get hurt
371	c: so mayb this is an area where you can if we were to think about a plan for you to be support to ronni in achiev his goal mayb that an area where you could ask him to make some chang like how about if we start out with you know not go there and see how it goe
372	c: okay alrighti so let talk about a plan- so your plan to support him is to make a healthi eat plan ?
373	c: okay so you said that you were plan to support him and that realli fit right in to what he said too is to increas fruit and veget and water he may not realiz the import of that
374	c: so you said save i wonder if check into some of the other resourc that i show you i wonder if that
375	c: but there are tip and trick you know to be abl to do it
376	c: such that initi it often more expens becaus you have to buy some thing that you might not have but as you start to get a suppli of them you know there less cost involv so should i put "check into resources" ?
377	c: it sound like you'v had some experi with be abl to do that
378	c: you know what anoth thing in addit to posit affirm is mayb think about past success and how you were abl to overcom ?
379	c: okay so there are some thing that you'r do right now so that there are thing at home and at the your grandma's-or her grandma hous
380	c: and you know i would recommend follow a similar process of you know when you want incorpor some new idea into your life and make it a habit or a lifestyl chang is you know to come up with a plan that doesn't just say "i want to do such and such" but that also say you know there are go to be some thing that'll make it more difficult and know what they are and how you'r go to deal with them in advanc is a good way to go you know caus it can contribut to success
381	c: okay so you have some concern that she weigh more than she should
382	c: so that a realli import thing that you see that there is a yeah there a relationship between weight and health problem
383	c: so again it kind of goe back to this idea of you'r readi to support her and that she realli need to kind of figur out what she would like to do
384	c: yeah it realli it realli hard to contain calori when you eat high calori food isn't it
385	c: yeah so you see that from your perspect it seem that the primari area that chang need to happen is with the junk food in particular
386	c: so you see yourself as be an import part of the chang that she need to make
387	c: so there are option there but it realli sound like this band is go to be veri time consum
388	c: so there are a number of thing that go into weight manag includ like you mention both nutrit and exercis
389	c: well you make a realli good point that when peopl have someon who either do the same thing with them or at least particip in some way that that help
390	c: so you'v made some huge chang at home as far as the food that avail in home for her
391	c: so on the one hand it might be kind of a lot of time that go into that and take her away from other thing but on the other hand it probabl go to be an activ thing becaus it a lot of march
392	c: like that so but it good inform to have becaus now that you know you could do someth differ yeah
393	c: mm-hmm so she interest in focus on chang in nutrit and you'r think that anoth way you could be support is to focus on the activ so that she get the best of both
394	c: so stick with the band a littl while is someth that
395	c: rate import you said that you were right at the top level of import
396	c: so this is the time that you see that right this moment this is the time where the two of you can realli start to take step in the right direct
397	c: and whi is whi is that you want to do that ? what your motiv ?
398	c: okay so you-just to put a littl twist on what you were say you want to come up with an exercis plan that the two of you can do and the reason is becaus you feel like you'd each motiv each other more and be more commit to it i think i hear you say than a friend would be
399	c: is someth that might give her some activ
400	c: so you find a spiritu kind of motiv is realli help to you
401	c: laugh well that fair enough
402	c: okay well just to kind of tie that idea into someth you said earlier and that is that you'v made some chang in the home for your daughter and that is that you know mayb you'r do thing a littl bit differ as far as food prepar goe or the food that are avail to her 40:59
403	c: so that might be one area that it you know a lot of benefit could come from just small chang
404	c: so that might be anoth thing to focus on too like if you feel like your daughter eat out a fair amount then make chang in the choic she make when she eat out or mayb eat out less might be anoth option
405	c: and talk to her about what she might be will to do
406	c: so you see this kind of as an import thing to do becaus it set her up for success in the futur too
407	c: laugh in your mind this is happen i mean there noth that
408	c: you know and then you also mention get some of these fresh fruit and veget that you can replac with you know some of the other food
409	c: so you'r not you know you don't like the way as and there some health thing that are go on that you think might be relat to his weight or might not but it just pretti as you know not someth that you like to see yeah so you know there some stuff go on there and it sound like peopl have said that if you were to lose some weight some of that the health stuff might go away
410	c: yeah so you'r kind of concern about what go to happen when everybodi around him see that stuff
411	c: so you know if if you think about thing that peopl ordinarili do when they want to lose weight you mention a littl bit about activit ?
412	c: so it kind of find that balanc where you don't want to say it right out to him but at the same time
413	c: so everybodi in the famili kind of notic it and
414	c: so so there are a number of thing that you do that you know you tri to help her make those chang and
415	c: and that is you comment that she'll sometim say "oh just put that up ?
416	c: yeah so you see you see that you'r alreadi do a number of thing and
417	c: so you'v realli actual look into thing like surgeri or get it remov and they have suggest kind of make some chang with lifestyl to help it with weight loss
418	c: that might be a
419	c: but mayb give up a portion you know size 0:53:51
420	c: that might be an interest option for her you know it sound like that a repertoir there that you know you alreadi have in place
421	c: and as your daughter get you know more and more skill at do these kind of thing also you know this mayb this is someth for the two of you to think about you know for as a as a futur plan
422	c: so there a lot of stuff like physic that aren't realli great about his weight right now
423	c: you'r not realli sure where it came from it kind of surpris you
424	c: so you could go i'm go to write this down for you you could go to this websit and get ton of inform about portion size and calori per portion and they also sell book at the bookstor that are general pretti inexpens they even sell them at like cvs and walgreen calori counter
425	c: okay so some and other member in that side of the famili have a lot of weight problem too
426	c: but if you were to search someth like low calori thanksgiv dinner you know honest you'd get some good result and the good news is that some peopl think that just becaus you'r eat fewer calori that it has to be tasteless food or that it go to be tasteless food and it doesn't have to be so so that the good news i mean
427	c: or substitut that are reason tast so so there are lot of differ option out there it might be a matter of just learn you know to explor differ option and mayb go to the librari and look in a few book as well and
428	c: she might be a great resourc then
429	c: okay so you want to bring healthier food into the hous
430	c: well what are your thought i know you kind of mention that you went to the doctor and look at you know get actual you know surgeri for this and they said it wasn't right for him
431	c: so plan ahead
432	c: it sound like it a work in progress over time
433	c: okay okay and then you said with kirbi you'll keep talk to him and ask for support
434	c: so in some way if i'm abl to open that dialogu up for the two of you it sound like you know between the three of us we might be abl to work out some negoti
435	c: it sound like some of the dietitian have actual said like monitor this take his money away so he can't buy the stuff on his own
436	c: so you realli see some valu in kind of set her up to show you that she can stick with a plan befor you take the next step which might be let her take a class or someth along those line
437	c: so you realli see that the idea of have some social support or other peopl involv sound realli import ?
438	c: and you'v got stuff go on in your life and you'v put a lot of time and effort into this and he doesn't realli seem to want to make ani chang with it he pretti comfort in fact that he just want to walk around without a shirt on it doesn't bother him
439	c: her idea laugh so you know there might be someth interest for the two of you to talk over as far as you know what she realli look for when she look for somebodi to help her follow through on her workout ?
440	c: i think she has this idea in mind that it might take a littl more push
441	c: yeah it sound like you'r realli readi to you know jump on board and be like whatev my daughter need you know i will make sure it happen so okay
442	c: so you realli see yourself as plan ahead for be abl to help her out
443	c: i so so now that you have an idea for what you might like to do to help plan it sound like for you the big thing is be abl to have time organ in a way that will let you do the thing that you realli intend to do and want to do ?
444	c: yeah so i mean i guess the under messag that i hear in what you'r say is that mayb if you can start her off with some pretti solid routin get her into the habit that mayb that will carri through when she not with you
445	c: sport
446	c: wow so it so it seem like you know you'v check into a varieti of resourc
447	c: so there this idea that you know number one you need to kind of be more activ and do thing all the way to themselv
448	c: so that pretti that pretti minim
449	c: oh the footbal
450	c: so he got into a littl bit of troubl when he was there
451	c: which is not so bad
452	c: right and so it may be a matter of like is the car ride okay ? laugh you know to get there and so
453	c: is it close by where it kind of
454	c: those are great for you know as he kind of march around laugh 0:41:42
455	c: so he realli like to be with you
456	c: so if you were to think about way to support him and it almost sound like you realli need his input
457	c: okay so realli that activ piec help him to keep his weight lower
458	c: do thing with you
459	c: so so the doctor has talk to you about his his weight you know so much so that you agre to kind of come in here for the program and see what was go on
460	c: so someth more specif that written
461	c: food label
462	c: so actual two piec of inform right there you know read food label and also how to shop would be veri help to you
463	c: so so you you go to quit a few place to bring fruit and veget into the hous
464	c: so you'r kind of prepar to deal with thing when you'r there
465	c: yeah so you'r realli interest in the big the big kind of the big pictur of thing which you know it make a lot of a lot of sens and
466	c: well you know it kind of interest becaus you'r realli want him to take more respons for thing and put thing into play not be so depend on you
467	c: mm-hmm exact so you'r you know alreadi kind of use that that idea with this guid here
468	c: yeah for the everyday food
469	c: you gotta look 0:37:22 yeah what doe that mean ? right so this kind of inform realli give you a good base
470	c: and it you know someth that will be use for you 0:37:36
471	c: great so you'r do a lot of thing in term of shop
472	c: for a lot of peopl it it safe i think you'r it sound like safeti is a concern
473	c: yeah so you'r realli work
474	c: and you would go through it realli fast so
475	c: you'r realiz that kind of a lot of calori are come from drink and that doesn't realli make you feel hungri
476	c: cg: i'm tri to work it laugh becaus i have a nine year old and he kind of overweight than he is and he has a complex about it so you know buy yogurt now and he don't like yogurt but i forc him to eat it so yeah you don't want to have them deal with weight in the futur and even kind of the the feel

478	c: he realli dedic even after the season keep go with thing yeah
479	c: he tri to do someth about it now
480	c: cg- veri unhappi
481	c: so you realli actual are you know it in the work of get the treadmil
482	c: so the benefit of activ everybodi in the famili is kind of notic them to keep it up
483	c: okay great so both again famili thing what can you guy do togeth ? and then also look into other program like mayb other sport program that are out there
484	c: that kind of someth that make him help out around the hous a bit more becaus he like to go there
485	c: so you would you would think about limit tv and and game
486	c: when you have someth activ you don't want them fight laugh 0:47:06 you know you realli do want to have someth that they can do and some one idea is you know a treadmil or a a bike or someth they can do in the hous
487	c: okay so he anoth support person that has kind of been there with the weight
488	c: he kind of the mechan thing take it apart
489	c: and kind of keep anoth a lookout for you too
490	c: yeah so kind of provid realli healthi choic around and then the rest will come

496	c: okay well actual i mean it sound like for such a young ladi she has a lot of good organ skill
497	c: and you mention one thing is you see is import is for her to stay motiv
498	c: and you mention you know with activ that that one and when peopl chang the way they eat that anoth
499	c: so you know overal what i'm hear from you is that there is you know this idea that thing get a littl old after awhil and still find a way to keep them new and interest would be import for her and the idea that just becaus she has some limit right now it doesn't mean that they'll be there forev and that that might be import 37:41
500	c: so they'd be someth to build over time
501	c: so he realli has this you know certain thing he like to do and certain thing he doesn't he pretti stubborn you know
502	c: well i mean hope it still earli right ? you know mayb she'll as time goe on kind of learn how to accommod to some of those thing
503	c: so you help each other like
504	c: so you realli see yourself do it with her and

506	c: but at the same time you know you'r there for him and you'r take him you'r do it anyway right ? you'r not go to say no
507	c: well i mean you mention that you get up at ten and that you go and work out and then the other thing i heard you say is that you get up and you walk around the mall
508	c: you know would it be possibl to use either of those two time to build in a littl more brisk activ for her ? you know would that help to offset some of it dure the week chang that you'v 55:27 up make 55:30 ?
509	c: okay so mayb that one way to solv the problem that is just that when you notic that it difficult to get start in the even laugh caus you'v alreadi been start throughout the day is to look at the schedul and see if there a way to shift prioriti around a littl bit so that they feel better work better
510	c: so that you actual even went and tri to get just anoth guy
511	c: but there a bit of a wait list
512	c: yep and so you know one of the thing i hear you say is that it realli import for health reason just to make you know chang that are good for health
513	c: so you'r realli advoc some healthi all around chang not just to weight but also to you know the way she interpret what peopl say and
514	c: okay so you'r just go to rope him in laugh
515	c: yep get the whole famili involv
516	c: so get a littl bit more from him in term of that you know you would say it to him
517	c: so you'r realli interest in get what his input is becaus you have tri quit a few differ thing and then instead of write out a formal plan without him you would need him to have more like "mom this is what i want" you want him to realli say that so he kind of in it
518	c: so you want him to mean it
519	c: so he kind of set up kind of a pattern that he not so believ and he not realli go to follow through with a lot of thing so what go to make this differ you know what now yeah
520	c: so that whole idea of the male role model is real strong for you
521	c: lot of women lot of women
522	c: so his behavior is kind of realli get in the way of a lot of thing for peopl
523	c: so it kind of your room he should stay out of it but it doesn't sound like he is

525	c: so there are a lot of thing as far as the food goe that you realli notic especi with all the time that you'v gone to see dietitian and nutritionist and peopl in the past but it not realli anyth that he paid attent to you know
526	c: so i mean he kind of where he at right now but he make some huge movement forward
527	c: so you'r you'r share it too
528	c: so he kind of make some chang on his own
529	c: and your famili is support that by give him
530	c: and so it not just a one as he not do it all on his own
531	c: oh so grow up a littl bit get more outgo and
532	c: okay so you'r not realli sure becaus you realli as he not a junk food eater

535	c: he take care of the health of his granddad and
536	c: yeah so it kind of take the focus complet not on as much on him but he get the benefit from do that too
537	c: so your famili realli has creat a veri support
538	c: so it still is this kind of question about where where it is come from
539	c: so he realli kind of keep that trajectori of the weight loss which is veri
540	c: so that kind of ad up a littl bit and by take that out
541	c: it gave him some posit stuff
