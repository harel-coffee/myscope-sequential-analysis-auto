45	c: one small thing at a time
46	c: and that kind of a way that peopl can have extra calori throughout the day
47	c: so yeah there is some inform in here that i'll kind of share when we come togeth in the end about eat and activ and we also have a program that go to be come up start next year that is much more than one session it about six month long and you know you'd meet with somebodi about twice a week so if that sound like someth you'r interest in more inform about caus you don't get a lot done in one singl session then you can let me know and i'll be happi to give you that info okay ?
48	c: and one of the thing that a lot of time i talk about with peopl is is activ or i talk about food and and the eat part of thing

50	c: would you want to hear some of that ?
51	c: well sometim peopl will add in just one veget to whatev meal they'r have like their lunch or dinner just to kind of start slow so they might add thing in like you know a salad or or cut up carrot or other veget that they that they like to eat
52	c: you know it sound like some inform about how peopl add veget into their their diet might be help
53	c: so you have some idea well if you'd like when kind of like we'll we'll after we switch place and thing i can get a littl handout that give some idea for peopl on how they add veget into their diet and we can take a a look at that with your mom
54	c: laugh okay it kind of it recommend for health that peopl tri to get about 60 minut of activ in everi day and =
55	c: either so it sound like becaus you are lose weight when you'r activ with sport and so it seem like you either your choic is to either be activ with sport all the time or to cut your food your calori when you'r not you know when you'r in the off season
56	c: alright well i do have some inform here about idea that we could talk about or mayb you have some of your own idea about what you might want to chang
57	c: to take a look ? okay alright so i'm go to leav all this stuff with you caus this is some other exercis idea and stuff but you want to focus on the nutrit so exercis so okay so whi don't we just go through kind of get a bird eye view of all these and then you can see which one or two or if ani you want to mayb think about
58	c: okay so this one talk about drink and the differ calori that are in drink
59	c: okay so one piec of inform that might be help is even to know how much you would need so would you like me to talk to you a littl bit more about that ?
60	c: okay so a pound of weight is 3500 calori basic that a whole pound so if you were go to lose a pound a week what we do is we basic divid this by seven day so i don't know if math is your best thing but seven divid by 3500 or 3500 divid by seven is 500 calori a day
61	c: okay so cut 500 calori a day doesn't seem like that much to you right now so let keep that in mind when you kind of take a look at this so here drink ani kind of sugar drink pretti much will be about a hundr calori a drink so i don't know you know that one think to think about the other thing so even like juic you know even fruit juic is 120 calori for a cup so that one area then we talk about fast food and you could see here there lot of thing that have 500 calori even like just a fri chicken sandwich is 800 for exampl so if you cut that out or substitut it with a 300 calori you know sandwich you would like if you substitut well here a garden salad with grill chicken instead of the fri chicken that would be 500 right there or let say you had a grill chicken sandwich instead of fri chicken that would be 300 and then you'd onli need to cut out like a drink or two you know what i'm say ? so let see what els ? and then there the portion size which is you know basic tell you you know how much like portion the differ calori are and to cut your portion so those are some differ area that you could look at
62	c: some kid find that when they skip meal they get realli hungri and then they eat more at the next meal is that someth that happen ?
63	c: okay so anoth possibl is to add like some small meal earli on so that you don't overeat you know at your next meal that anoth thought
64	c: okay well some peopl find it help to for awhil to record
65	c: okay some kid find it help to write down the goal that they'r make and other kid prefer just to talk about them
66	c: okay caus i have this goal sheet here somewher inaud oh no she gave us this one twice okay alright i got two parent one by accid laugh let me go see if she can grab me a regular one and then we can continu that
67	c: yeah caus i know the wii you know you can get move on it; the problem is some peopl end up pull it out like onc a week or you know it kind of get in the habit
68	c: okay other peopl you know have to do it the night befor caus they kind of roll out of bed and go but it sound like you'll be abl to manag that
69	c: you could even do that tonight and set that all up on the wii fit okay so you got the wii fit scale a coupl thing about monitor your weight that i can share with you if you'r interest
70	c: if you are go to weigh yourself everyday which is good
71	c: so what do you think of that inform ?
72	c: alright so then what you want to do is you know like you'r say if you'r weigh yourself everyday kind of see where you are at the end of the month you know befor you make a decis that "ohh you know this plan isn't working" laugh
73	c: it just a matter of get start with some small chang in the off season caus you know when you'r in the on season it a littl easier for you you know the other thing that sometim happen with athlet is that when they are off season it hard to adjust your food so when you'r on season you'r hungri a lot you'r activ and you'r eat and then you go off season and it hard to adjust
74	c: okay so some peopl find that they have more energi some peopl find that they get stronger some peopl find that they'r more relax or feel better
75	c: becaus a lot of time peopl that sit on the comput for a long time aren't be as activ as they could be becaus they'r sit on the comput
76	c: i mean make salad doe take a littl bit of work instead of just grab someth
77	c: mm-hmm so some kind find it help to like when you said just get up and do it like to make a plan to write down a plan that they can keep with them and other kid prefer to just talk about it
78	c: okay can i throw out some thing that mayb get in the way for other kid and you can see if ani of them fit ? one is that they have to have those thing around the fruit and veget
79	c: and just if it okay can i give you a littl bit of inform about weigh yourself regular ?
80	c: so weigh yourself everi day is a great way to monitor how you'r do and also can see you know like whether or not you'r ani of these thing are work or whether you need to do more but you also have to realiz that weight goe up and down everi day
81	c: okay i just want to make sure becaus sometim you know kid can get discourag but but the weigh yourself it sound like that was pretti like motiv like wow i realli need to do this the other thing is that we recommend weigh yourself when you first get up with the same cloth so same time of day same cloth on becaus that can also affect your weight
82	c: i think there hand out around here around fast food choic i'll leav all these with you</text>
83	c: now some kid find that when they start to make these chang they'r hungri becaus you'r you'r not eat as much
84	c: so if you go to the fast food restaur and you eat a salad and then you know two hour later you'r hungrier than you normal are
85	c: okay you want some idea ? i mean you said you want to eat more fruit and veget so one possibl is to have some healthier snack you know when you'r hungri like fruit or some other thing might be like pretzel or you know instead of chip or someth like that
86	c: okay well let think of what els might be anoth possibl is to have anoth small meal you know is to just have anoth like small you know chicken or grill chicken or you know someth that a littl more substanti than just a piec of fruit that realli will fill you up
87	c: well if you if you'd like i know that we have some inform about resourc around the area kind of a littl bit of a handout that i can get it might be help to look at togeth
88	c: mm-hmm versus like a bag of chip or a snack some peopl think like oh okay i alreadi had lunch so i'm just go to have a snack well guess what ? sometim those snack are wors than laugh anoth salad or anoth meal i'm just look here other idea are like low fat chees you know again just even eat a coupl of piec of turkey breast you know like lunch meat you know but healthi lunch meat like turkey breast those kind of thing
89	c: and you know sometim when i meet with peopl we kind of write down a plan caus that help for peopl to kind of rememb what they'r think about work on and sometim that plan is what they want to do or sometim it what they want to think about do
90	c: so with you know with weight right there usual peopl talk about exercis and activ you know level or stop do sit around kind of thing and peopl also talk about healthi eat
91	c: c so i have some inform here about what the recommend are for physic activ to lose weight would you like to take a look at them ?
92	c: so okay so the ultim goal and again you know i'm not say that tomorrow you'r go to start it but is you want to tri to do some activ for an hour a day
93	c: so i can leav this with you becaus it'll just help you track like you know your goal of tri to do someth everyday and mayb eventu work up to this what do you see as get in the way ?
94	c: so if it okay with you we could talk a littl bit about what are some realist goal and how you can see if your plan is work ?
95	c: okay so you know typic for weight loss we'r look at a goal of one to two pound a week so if you are lose a pound a week you know that would be someth you should be excit about which is not ten or 20 pound in a month but it like about a pound a week ?
96	c: okay alright so you'r interest and the other thing to realiz is weight can go up and down so you might look at it everi week but don't make a decis on whether you'r success until the end of the month you know what i'm say ? like if you'v lost-caus some week like if you have your period or you'v had a lot of salt you'r weight can be higher but if you'v lost like about four pound by the end of the month you know then you know you'r on track ?
97	c: okay so let think about the pound to two pound a week
98	c: okay four pound and over five month then that would be 20 so mayb 20 to 40 pound
99	c: so you know if you'r talk about veget with salt versus chip with salt it you know you'r say that veget with salt even if the salt not great it still better than the chip with salt so it sound like mayb substitut you know at least onc a day veget instead of chip how mani time a day do you eat chip ?
100	c: okay okay and befor you leav i want to doubl check about if we have ani recommend for scale that are accur you know where your weight is ?
101	c: you know we have a littl inform about type of food and figur out you know healthi thing would you be interest in hear about that kind of stuff ? well it interest becaus you mention stuff about the fruit snack and a lot of time those are actual not realli have a lot of fruit in them =
102	c: weigh pattern to just see how thing are go you know i have a littl inform about you know weigh yourself and keep your your program in check would you want to hear someth like that ?
103	c: but you know sometim it that if you weigh yourself too frequent becaus your weight natur chang over you know some period and sort of dure certain time of the month so sometim peopl need a a good month of weigh themselv to see what their bodi normal doe
104	c: well a lot of time when i meet with peopl they put togeth you know they write down some kind of a plan on what they might realli want to focus in on and you have a plan that you'r work on right now
105	c: yeah and that when peopl have the most success is when they'r realli honest with themselv
106	c: and you know i have some info in here as far as like differ stuff and if it okay with you i'll just kind of like tell you what in here
107	c: i'v got info in here about like portion size inform on like choos healthi thing when you eat out like in a fast food restaur and inform on beverag you know get a lot of calori from thing that we drink and then some inform on activ as well ani of those
108	c: well yeah a lot of time when you eat out at fast food restaur or or other restaur those food have more fat and calori in them
109	c: yeah and so as far as it goe with the balanc then yeah you know peopl a lot of time will need to do more activ more exercis in order to balanc out those calori
110	c: and a lot of time when i work with peopl the more specif they can get on what they want to do as far as activ or pick one thing as far as eat that they realli want to focus on it can be realli help for them to be success
111	c: yeah and you realli are mention a lot with the the cake and the cooki and and how much you kind of see that relat to your weight and i don't know for you know for some peopl they they want to make some chang in their eat like you know cut down on thing and watch portion size and other peopl even you know they even though they know that this is caus their weight gain it not someth that they'r readi to to work on
112	c: you know the thing that you kind of said about the sugar make me just kind of wonder if you'v heard you know ani inform about this idea of portion size
113	c: so and i have some other handout and thing you can look at later about you know exercis
114	c:
115	c: but this realli break down this idea that for for everyon especi for peopl that are tri to lose weight the goal is to do 60 minut of activ everi day and for a lot of peopl it can be broken down into thing like do aerob activ strength activ and stretch and some peopl start at smaller amount than 60 everi day and work up to it you know to get to that goal like mayb ten minut and other peopl will do stuff like everi other day or they'll pick a coupl day of the week to do thing
116	c: you know the whole idea of go to a gym if that okay anoth thing that i kind of want to point out on here is this idea that peopl who are do a lot of thing like watch a lot of tv or be on the comput a lot often time aren't be activ you know becaus you'r sit there and watch those and so peopl find that they have a better time or they they'r abl to lose weight by cut you know cut down on some of the time that they spend watch tv or be on the comput
117	c: okay alright so what do you want to you know where do you want to go from here ? some peopl that i work with when we get to this point will say you know "i don't want to work on anyth it was realli nice to come in and talk to you but this wasn't realli help for me and i'm i just i want to leav you know the room" and other peopl will say like you know what ? i realli want to make a plan i want to think about what i can do mayb start like next week or even start like tomorrow and i want to just kind of see if i can put it down on paper becaus that will be help for me ?
118	c: well well tell me you'v you know talk a lot about you know the activ side of thing be where you would like to focus your energi becaus a lot with the eat is someth that you'r alreadi work on so i'm go to kind of say like what your your plan is and you know just just to kind of let you know when i work with peopl a lot of time the most specif that they can get about the plan like kind of make like realli small littl thing that they can start with often time is is help becaus then they will you know see littl they won't they'll be abl to kind of reach those easier but that doesn't alway work for everybodi
119	c: and when we come back togeth and you know kind of the three of us sit down as we go how would you you know want to share that with her ? you know what would you say ? if you were like alright mom this is my plan this is what i'm go to do
120	c: a lot of time when i meet with peopl we kind of put togeth a littl bit of a plan
121	c: this kind of you know walk through what your plan you know might be
122	c: silli me well i guess when i you know sometim when i meet with peopl like sometim when peopl don't have anyth for a while and they they go and they see some ice cream and they see cake or whatev it is they just want to have so much of it they kind of overeat way too much
123	c: yeah alright you know i have a coupl thought i don't know if i could share with you ?
124	c: you know if i can kind of share with you that actual you know a healthier for some peopl a healthier approach so that they don't go to that crazi i'm go to eat the whole gallon of ice cream extrem
125	c: and you know peopl who want to be success with weight loss do all the thing that you'r mention right now you know they they make a plan they get other peopl to support them they you know work you know write it down and remind themselv and and they also kind of keep push through you know like they'll they'll have a treat and then they'll get back to their plan and those thing so you have a realli healthi approach to to manag your weight
126	c: okay i i do have some inform here about where your weight is compar to other kid your age if you'd like to take a look at it okay so basic did they tell you what your weight was when you got here ? like 242
127	c: okay this sheet i'll leav it with you has some other inform about like other risk like diabet and heart condit and thing that you can get if your weight stay high so i'll just leav those for you
128	c: so you can work on that becaus i have some inform here too there all kind of thing here we don't need to look at all of them i just want to pick out the one that realli match what you'r tell me and what you'r tell me is you want to focus on physic activ and this here talk about what they what recommend for weight loss is that someth you might want to take a look at ? yes mm-hmm so three day a week of high intens and then four day a week mix up you know aerob with strength and stretch
129	c: sometim okay i have some inform here about drink if you want to see those
130	c: mm-hmm gatorad is can give you energi but again most gatorad is go to have the same calori so here oh here it is sport drink it a littl bit less but than juic than juic but still is definit you know some more than than the water
131	c: okay alright so some kid find it help to write down their goal and other kid prefer to just talk about them
132	c: well i know that this is a weight loss project so that the main topic for our convers is to talk about weight loss
133	c: that one thing that sometim peopl do is they join a group or
134	c: you know i have some inform about beverag if you'd be interest like you know how to-what you'r drink and energi and that
135	c: well if it make you to feel-if it help you to feel more comfort there are no right or wrong answer the reason that we'r talk today is for me to just help you think through some of these thing becaus it can be difficult to think through them and so i have some experi think through what chang peopl want to make and so some of the question that i'm ask you are not for me to judg what you'r say or anyth it for it to help you start organ your thought in a way that you can say "oh okay so if i need to eat healthier or if i feel like i want to do some exercises" eventu i want to help you get to a plan for how you can do that okay ? and so if you just say what come to mind that fine it doesn't have to be a great answer it doesn't have to be a long one it whatev in your own head is fine okay ?
136	c: so this is actual talk about what are you drink and it talk about this idea that a lot of time sport drink energi drink anyth that like a fruit drink or flavor ice tea and a lot of soft drink realli have littl or no nutrit valu and drink a liter or more of these a day could actual look like in a week about one pound a week
137	c: you don't know sometim peopl get to a point where they'r think hey wait a minut i don't have to wait to do this stuff i could just play outsid today
138	c: if i want to help you come up with a plan that you could leav with today and start do we could do that a coupl differ way
139	c: so part of what we'v alreadi done is we'v alreadi talk through most of a plan i don't know if you were realiz that we were do that but we'v alreadi talk through almost an entir plan and so some peopl decid that when they'r readi to make a chang now like you said they talk about it and they just put some idea in their head so that they can say okay now i know when i leav here today here what i'm go to do first and here the kind of help i need other peopl say you know that that realli a great idea and i'd like to write it down so that in case i forget what to do or i get off track i can just look at it again and get back on track again
140	c: okay alright so so if we were go to come up with a plan then the first step would be to pick your goal which you'v done alreadi
141	c: okay let see so so this is kind of one way to think about rememb i said i was go to help you think about what you'd like to do and how you might be abl to do it ? you'v alreadi said that your plan is to be abl to play basketbal right ?
142	c: so it actual realli just kind of talk about the amount of calori in differ type of food and their size
143	c: okay so sometim when peopl have a plan that they would like to do no matter how import it is to them sometim someth get in the way
144	c: some peopl have told me befor becaus i'v work with a number of peopl who'v been kind of in your posit where there someth they realli want to do but they kind of have to do it in a way that other peopl can do it with them sometim what they decid to do is okay well you know my grandma need to walk and i'll go with her but later i'm go to go out with my brother and walk again
145	c: so you bring up an interest point and that is what we call daili fluctuat or daili chang in a person weight and i have a littl bit of inform about that if you'd like me to share it with you so for one it normal for peopl weight to fluctuat day to day so if you were to weigh yourself everi singl day one thing you might notic is that like you mention befor you might be 218 one day and then 222 and then 220 and it kind of goe back and forth the import thing is to kind of watch how that chang over time and so in let say a one month period you were to go from 218 down to say 212 or even 213 that a pretti healthi amount of weight to lose and it show a trend over time that it goe down but day to day it might not it might chang up and down a littl bit day to day the thing that you mention about the 178 to 195 i suspect it probabl just where the scale was on the floor or someth becaus that that doesn't that doesn't sound like someth that would happen for somebodi to gain that much weight
146	c: yeah so some of that some of that what you'r say is sound like normal fluctuat and some of it doesn't some of it sound like the scale or like mayb where it place so some of those littl scale with the littl dial on the top where you have to calibr it they'r not the most accur so it wouldn't be unusu to find some fluctuat that in addit to your normal fluctuat so if you were like i was mention befor with healthi weight loss if you were look at drop about one or two pound a week on averag that would be a healthi weight loss
147	c: okay so there are a few place i can share some inform with you if you like
148	c: so you could check onlin about chang in bodi shape anoth realli good place to check is with your doctor is just ask about that and about when your stomach get flatter but your weight doesn't chang what doe that mean so those are some realli good place to start
149	c: okay i have some other thought about differ area that you could think about if you want to hear them
150	c: so some peopl to choos you know to focus on a particular thing like they might say you know "i realli want to do this bike or swim walking" that kind of thing and so they might choos to set a goal for themselv and plan out how they might do it other peopl might choos to work on nutrit and they say "you know it seem like i'm do the right thing but i can also see some area where i could improv that would help me" so they might decid "you know mayb if i just cut out 500 calori each day if i realli look at the food i'm eat and figur out where i can trim those down a littl bit" or they might choos to focus on someth like stick to a lower calori plan overal smaller portion size that sort of thing
151	c: it just so happen that i have someth in here that might be of help to you if you would like to look at it with me okay so let me get this out i actual do have a lot of resourc in here which i will give to you but i think we'll just focus on the thing that you just mention right now let see so what you'r talk about you describ someth call a food log
152	c: okay so i'm go to give you a food log just want to take a moment to go over again ?
153	c: so this one is similar in some way mean so you can start with the date and time from when you ate you can write down what you ate and drank per day so one thing would go on each line which may be what you did befor how much you ate so your portion size where did the food come from mean was it cook at home did it come from a restaur did it come from you know the corner store ? you know that kind of thing and here the calori column so you can keep track of calori this part where it say what did you substitut it for this would be kind of like you mention
154	c: yeah instead of fri tri to have bake you know so did you substitut bake chicken for fri yeah how mani calori did you save by do that that someth you could choos to do if you want to keep track of that so if you thought well if i substitut bake for fri how mani calori did that save me ? and how hungri were you when you sat down to eat becaus that might make a differ when peopl are realli hungri they might eat more but if you also find that a lot of time you'r have a snack when you'r not actual hungri that might be a place that could point out for yourself you know this is someth i could probabl cut out becaus here is an exampl of a time when i'm eat and i'm not actual hungri or here an exampl of a time when i had a bigger portion but i wasn't actual that hungri and by the same token you might notic wow here a time when i actual did feel hungri but i stuck to a smaller portion and i wasn't hungri afterward so you can use that as a learn tool and how did you feel so was your mood associ with eat more or less and how help is that for you so there some benefit to use a food log like this like you said so if you would like to use that one this one avail for you and i'll give that to you in your folder
155	c: some peopl when they identifi what would be a great first step for them they come up with a plan some peopl just think about it and keep it in their head and other one want to write it down so that they can hang it on the fridg or some place where they can see it and help stick to it
156	c: so in this plan this is just a way to help keep your plan organ and save you could write down what your plan to do is so you mention keep a food log whi you want to do that and then in this section what you and i will talk through and i'll help you with this is we can figur out thing that might get in the way of you be abl to keep use this and what you might do if those thing happen and then the first step that you'r go to take in order to reach your goal and someth your mom could do to help you reach your goal
157	c: i have a littl chart if you don't mind take a look at it with me that show your weight compar to the weight of some other girl your age you may have seen someth like this befor caus you mention have a chart that you'v look at so this chart right here take your height and weight and put it on this-
158	c: okay so this is what call a growth chart and it realli just say for somebodi who is your age and your what they call bodi mass index which is a comput of your height and your weight that this green section right here is the averag this is too littl weight this is overweight this red area is what they call obes so anyth over that 95th percentil this is where you are right here so you'r in the 98th percentil which mean that even though you might not feel like you'r bigger than some of the other girl the comput between how tall you are and how much you weigh for your age is much on the larger side
159	c: okay alright so larg if you want to focus on chang in eat i have an idea for someth that we could do if you'r interest i have a plan a sheet that will help us make a plan for a chang that you might like to make would you be interest in work on that ? sure
160	c: do you know anyth about look at label like how to read label and what to look for on them ? do you mind if i show you ? i have some thing in here that might be help
161	c: so this is a list of healthi food that could be found in restaur and fast food choic i know that sometim these burger restaur like burger king and mcdonald have thing like this that are like healthi choic this yogurt parfait so if we were to look at healthi choic versus unhealthi choic one of the thing that i'm look at is how big this number is
162	c: yep so for someth that look like a snack 200 calori is about what they'r say is a good snack size
163	c: so if you were to look at the back of that peanut butter and appl snack that you mention and you say that it was about that big or mayb even around 100 then that would be a pretti good size snack
164	c: and so one of the thing that not said on here is that it not onli the calori that make food healthi or unhealthi it the way they'r prepar becaus they can have other thing in them
165	c: so the fri food have a lot of oil in them what we call satur fat so those food even though the calori might not be as high for this as they are here it still make this a less healthi choic than this
166	c: well peopl think differ thing when they have somebodi who say someth not veri nice to them some peopl just kind of let it roll off and say "well they don't realli know what they'r talk about" and other peopl might get mad and they might go off by themselv some peopl might decid "you know what ? i'm just not go to give them anyth to talk about anymor i'm gonna make some changes"
167	c: well so when peopl decid that they would like to work on weight loss they do some of the veri same thing that you'v done they make choic to do someth differ and usual peopl choos to chang someth about their activ level which you'v start do becaus you'r work out at lunch time and they also decid to chang someth about the way that they eat which you'r do also becaus you'r cut out junk food and sugar so if you want to keep work on those kind of thing i might be abl to help you come up with anoth idea that you might choos to work on
168	c: mmm yeah that sound like someth realli worth check into to see what the kind of chang you could mak
169	c: okay so mayb that one step you could take would be to talk to your guidanc counselor or social worker about how to not get in troubl when this guy is talk to you and you feel like you'r get blame for it
170	c: which is true i think of everybodi nobodi catch it a hundr percent of the time
171	c: so sometim when peopl think about what kind of chang they want to make they come up with a plan they decid "you know here what i realli want to work on i want to practic more" and then we can either talk about a plan or we could write it down so that you could rememb it more easili
172	c: well i have some inform relat to whi you might be here today and it has someth to do with someth call your bodi mass index do you want to hear about that ?
173	c: so mayb this will help i have a sheet in here i can show you if that interest to you let see so one of the thing that we know about how activ relat to weight loss and in this case it could also be help with give you more practic time is that this is what recommend for activ if peopl were to be activ three day a week for 60 minut each day high intens do you know what that mean ? it kind of like if you think about when you are activ enough that you can feel your heart beat and like if you were to tri to like sing the happi birthday song for exampl like you wouldn't be abl to you might be abl to say it but you wouldn't be abl to sing it becaus you'r work that hard ?
174	c: okay so mayb not quit at the level where you'r readi to pass out but just befor that where you feel like mayb you'r sweat and you feel like you'r heart beat and you feel like you could keep go but it not veri easi
175	c: yeah yeah exact so some of the thing that you might do for that 60 minut includ a warm up so a littl bit of stretch your aerob exercis for the 60 minut
176	c: and stretch afterward you do some kickbox ? so mayb this will give you some idea here anoth one like walk fast so if you were to and run caus that the kind of stuff that you would do in footbal right ? so those are some differ idea ?
177	c: okay so that even more than what this recommend ?
178	c: so would that be someth you'd like to see or not realli ?
179	c: mm-hmm yeah some peopl also find that they have to well peopl have told me that when they hang it up somewher where they can see it like mayb on their fridg or someth that it help becaus it remind them everi day ?
180	c: all right so it a new thing all right well to kind of put us on the same page your bodi mass index or your bmi actual talk about as it a number that talk about what your weight is in ratio to your height and then they take that number and they tell you what your diseas risk might be in relat to your weight so at your age you'r actual plot on a growth chart you are compar to all the guy that are your age so when we look at the growth chart here you actual fall for other boy your age abov the 99 percentil in term of your weight or your bodi mass index and that put you right here in this gray no dark gray area mean that out of 100 boy your age you would weigh more than about 99 of them and your diseas risk would be a littl bit elev becaus you'r in this gray area
181	c: and that might be an interest question to ring up for your doctor they may be abl to give you some more inform about that i can give you some inform about where you fall on-hav you seen the growth chart that show like what percentil you'r in for height and weight and that kind of thing ? i have one with your specif inform on it if you'd like to look at it okay so let see it here so this chart right here is realli just focus on weight but the peopl that you were work with earlier put your inform into this growth chart and what it show is that if we look at where somebodi is for your age and if we look at you know enter in your height and it come up with a bmi or bodi mass index show that this yellow area would be somebodi who underweight this green area would be somebodi who in the expect rang for weight this is over weight and this is the obes rang and so that look like that might be a surpris to you that you actual fall in what we call the 96th percentil anyth over the 95th percentil is obes
182	c: yeah yeah it sometim i mean peopl carri their weight differ and if you'r veri activ and if you have a lot of muscl that may go into it a littl bit too becaus muscl weigh more but if you look at this chart you can see that you know this rang is where you fall right now this is the rang that would be a healthi weight for somebodi your height and age okay ? and it doesn't give you inform specif to the number of pound it actual list it by bodi mass index which is a calcul between height and weight
183	c: yep that the 50th percentil that exact averag for your height and age so a bmi of 22 and you actual fall at i think it 30 just about 30 okay ?
184	c: well this idea here is that this lighter area down here would be consid of a healthi weight rang this is a healthi weight rang and this would be kind of get higher and then this would be increas risk of diseas relat to your weight
185	c: c so that is one thing that sometim peopl do when they want to do what we call weight manag so they tri to be more activ there are other thing that peopl do too would you be interest in hear about some of the other thing ? okay so peopl sometim chang what they eat and they chang how much they eat and when i say they chang what they eat they might make differ choic so they might decid to have healthier food like more fruit and veget for exampl and less junk food or less meat becaus those thing tend to be higher in calori so the more calori you take in the more you weigh and it a matter of kind of keep a balanc so your activ that you mention help take away or burn some of the calori but it can't do it all by itself so what a lot of peopl find is that they have to have a balanc of both more activ plus chang to their eat
186	c: okay so i do have some idea on thing that you might be abl to chang as far as nutrit goe and mayb you can look at some of the handout i have and mayb make a choic about which one might be the best one for you to focus on would that be okay ? okay
187	c: you'r this one right here
188	c: okay so some of these might be less relev for you then so for exampl this hand out give you inform about differ thing that you drink and you can kind of compar the amount of calori like for exampl for a sport drink for these differ size of drink these are how mani calori are in each-gener i mean some vari a littl bit but you can see that if you had fast food drink beverag mean a fountain soda that you might also get at a store like a gas station peopl would get a fountain soda there you can see that a 12 ounc drink is usual between 110 and 120 calori wherea a sport drink is onli 75 can pop 12 ounc is 150 so that even more than fountain drink then you can see there are some other choic here too like let see if we can find anoth one that pretti compar well like a diet drink has no calori crystal light an eight ounc onli has 5 which mean a 12 ounc is not much more than that it probabl around seven or eight yeah
189	c: yeah so some peopl decid that if they drink a lot of high calori beverag that that a real you know place that they could focus and make some big chang without a lot of effort this is anoth idea now these are-i'm go to show this one to you anyway just becaus it might be worthwhil look at-but these are for restaur and fast food but i think the same would appli for if you had similar food like in your home you can see that for burger for exampl these are some healthi choic and these are some unhealthi choic now each of these would be about one serv each of these would be one serv but you can see if you choos these kind of meal or item for your meal that you actual take in a lot less calori than you do with these kind of item there are some similar with chicken and taco and a few other that we have too pizza if you like asian food
190	c: yeah so it not a-it not exact what you'r eat right now but it might give you kind of an idea of oh okay so mayb there are some thing that we cook at home that we might make differ choic and take in less calori the other thing is this right here you were talk earlier about serv size and portion size sometim it can be realli hard to know how much you'r eat if you don't have a label and these are kind of some guidelin to show you you know if you have typic item that you'r familiar with like a comput mous or a tenni ball or a basebal that give you a good idea of what a one serv size for like a cup of cereal or a comput mous which is about this big is a half cup size for the exampl that they'r use is bake potato so that would also help you to watch serv size when you don't have a label avail to tell you
191	c: bring this down into other area
192	c: you might check that out and see i mean i know that there are a number of book that are written so that might be one way to tell anoth way to tell is that usual unless they have sauc that is on them the frozen veget are pretti compar to the fresh one as far as nutrit and calori content so mayb you might look at the label on a frozen veget and compar it to what a can one say and see if it realli make a differ for you so that anoth idea
193	c: there someth els that you could do day to day that might be help to you in know whether your bodi size is chang or not that how tight your cloth fit so you can kind of use that as an estim as you know like if you find that your pant are get looser for exampl then you know that your size is go down yeah but by the same token if your pant are get harder to button and that kind of thing then you know it go up okay ? so those are some pretti decent idea that you might be abl to use
194	c: yep i have such a list here if you'd like to see it i can show you how to use it if you want okay so for keep track of food  for exampl some peopl find it help to do just what you did and that is to write down what they'v had and peopl choos to write down differ bit of inform about what they eat but i think like the main thing is what time and when what date that you ate someth what it was you were talk a littl bit about portion size or serv size so you might be abl to write down how mani serv you had some other inform that you may find help is where the food came from so like for exampl did it come from the store or was it homemad did it come from a restaur or did somebodi els make it that kind of thing how mani calori it has so you were talk a littl bit about look at the label and that where you can get that inform as you see chang that you like you might think to yourself "well gosh you know i realli want to have this hamburg tonight but instead i had half a hamburg instead i had a sandwich" and so you can see you know choic that you make might be help to you too and if you were to do that compar what you want to what you actual had you might be abl to calcul out how mani calori you save by make that choic too some peopl also find it help to evalu how hungri they are when they eat to see if they'r realli eat when they'r truli hungri or if they'r eat just becaus the food was there you know and if so you might decid "huh i notic that i'm do that a lot i better make some chang in that area" and other peopl find that mood is relat to when and how much they eat too and these are thing that like you mention unless you realli have some list that you can refer back to it hard to realli know you can onli realli guess
195	c: okay so yeah bring this part down actual decreas your possibl risk for diseas and what would you =
196	c: mm-hmm so peopl do sometim use remind like that they set alarm on their phone or tri to think like when i realli realli want to rememb someth i tri to put it somewher where i'm go to see it
197	c: so it more that this isn't a veri good pictur
198	c: okay and now a lot of peopl find that you know as they'r think through specif chang that they might like to make they can think of thing that could stop them or get in their way make it difficult
199	c: so what this is say is you'r right and you'r say that you as peopl who are in a healthi weight rang are in this area down here and then as they get up higher into the darker rang up here then it a less as it not as much of a healthi weight so peopl that drop their weight or drop their bmi into a healthier rang have better health
200	c: so this the dark one that go through is kind of throw us a bit it actual this is where you'r at right now you'r this dot up here and you know your age and appli your bmi
201	c: i mean some peopl just kind of assum that they can just you know mayb do a littl bit more than they usual do but they don't have a real plan for it
202	c: and fall into a lower part even if it not all the way down here will be healthier for you
203	c: when peopl think about you know the thing that they do for weight loss and what they need to do they often come up with a coupl differ thing
204	c: and peopl also make anoth chang they usual chang what they eat or how much they eat
205	c: okay alright so what if we talk about thing that you could do and i have some inform in here that i can show you if you'r interest
206	c: so peopl who think about low medium and high intens activ as be like you know the song peopl sing happi birthday when somebodi has a birthday if you were sing that song and you were abl to sing it pretti comfort you'd be do like mild intens activ and if you were abl to sing it but you have to take extra breath so it wouldn't be realli smooth that would be like moder or medium intens activ and if you could onli say it and you'd probabl have to take some breath there too then that more like high intens activ okay ? so that someth that you might give it a tri just to kind of see where you'r at and if you need to improv the intens of your activ okay ? so in the 60-minut period you might think about 20 minut of stretch on either end 20 minut of strength train and aerob activ and this is where the weight loss will realli come into play is with the aerob activ that you do but these other thing help too
207	c: so i do have a handout about that are you interest in take a look at it ?
208	c: then this final column say how long would i watch tv ? but it might not be just tv it could be anyth that involv like sit or not be veri activ so read which is healthi in some way caus it work out your mind but not so much your bodi same with tv and video game so kind of like comput time
209	c: our bodi start to chang and we don't realli get a good sens of where that come from becaus you might not be do thing a whole lot differ or mayb you are but don't realiz it
210	c: so that can be a pretti strong motiv
211	c: well if you were to be in this rang right here becaus this is your age come up here right if you were to be bring this down into this rang like that lighter part that would put you at overweight into this overweight rang and then if you bring it into this other part down here that would be more into that would be a normal weight rang
212	c: okay alright so some peopl decid that they would like to just talk about their plan and other peopl decid "you know what ? it would realli help me if i had a written plan that i can rememb that i can hang up in my hous somewher and keep track of"
213	c: yeah so and crave can be veri difficult to deal with you know lot of peopl struggl with crave and if you'r interest we can talk a littl bit about crave okay so you know if you think about when you have a crave it usual for a specif food
214	c: so someth sweet okay the good news about crave is they realli are just crave it not someth your bodi has to have and they do go away like if you ever find yourself in a posit where you realli want a candi bar like realli bad but you weren't in a posit to get one caus either you didn't have the money to get one on you or like it was the begin of the day at school and you knew it was go to be like six hour befor you could go so you'd just have to wait right
215	c: okay so a lot of peopl do find that social support like friend and famili is realli help to them so
216	c: so activ is one thing that you'r definit that peopl do in order to help to manag their weight and to lose weight and the other side of that would be the nutrit part
217	c: which is help becaus that how peopl accomplish their goal is they come up with idea that realli mean someth to them and then they'r more like to follow through on them so
218	c: okay well i'm wonder if it would be interest to you to see where you weight fall on a graph as far as bodi mass index goe ?
219	c: okay well so what we did today is becaus the peopl here the research assist that we work with they weigh you earlier and then what they did is they put your weight into a comput along with your height and age and everyth so if you look at where you fall on a bodi mass index which is a comput of your height and weight for your age this is where you fall
220	c: yeah which mean that this is underweight this is averag weight and this is overweight this is obes so in the 97th percentil that pretti high it abov the 95th percentil which is the cutoff between overweight and obes
221	c: yeah that actual news to a lot of peopl becaus this isn't you know sometim peopl see a graph like this when they'r look at a growth chart but not alway i mean it not unusu for a person never to have seen one of these so and you can see too like along the bottom where you fall in and as you get older you can see that the bodi mass index that within the normal rang get a littl bit higher and that normal
222	c: well and we don't know where you'r head or how sharpli your curv is becaus we onli have one dot on here which mean we don't know if you were here or here or here the last time you know over the year and it hard to know just simpli becaus we onli have today data
223	c: so it the idea that some peopl are as will do thing to you know increas their activ or choos the type of thing that they'r eat in order to lose some weight
224	c: and peopl carri their weight differ way and so when you pictur in your mind you know what doe an obes person look like there isn't realli one shape that a person is or there isn't realli one you know weight that they have that say that they'r obes it like we said a comput and stuff so it might look differ for differ peopl
225	c: you know and that is someth that peopl do sometim is they chang their activ level ?
226	c: if they want to make a chang as far as their weight goe then they focus on increas their activ and they work on chang what they eat or how they eat
227	c: yeah a number of peopl do fall into that trap where it it easi to get to
228	c: i do have some inform on fast food that if you would like to see it i can pull that out as well and kind of
229	c: let start with this one i think i have anoth in here that might be use to you i'll give you a choic of a few differ one to look at
230	c: so if you were to think of way that you might want to focus on manag how you how you eat you could start with look at this this is a list of fast food choic the list of the type of fast food that peopl might eat and there are sever becaus there are lot of differ kind of food out there and what this doe is it give you healthier choic versus unhealthi choic if you'r go to eat out and so sometim peopl decid well i might not be abl to cut out all fast food but when i do have fast food mayb i can at least
231	c: </sample>
232	c: so in this set of paper this is a comparison between differ type of drink that peopl might have and it show you the size of the drink as well as how mani calori are in there and then mayb some other choic that you might make that could replac some or all of your fast food choic or your soda choic laugh and so as you can see these are the best choic becaus they have virtual no calori in them these are some good choic too though if you don't have too much
233	c: and then final a third choic that i want to mention to you is just keep track of your food
234	c: so basic all it is is just you write down everyth that you eat and drink even it just like a littl chees cube snack or someth you know drink or someth you just write the date and time and describ what it was and how much you had becaus portion like you can see on here the portion size is import and where it came from like did it come from a restaur ? did it come from home ? how mani calori it had you mention look at the nutrit label
235	c: if you want to these are some option column you could say you know what you had a substitut for so if you had water instead of a soda you could write down the calori that were in the soda as well as the calori that were in the water and then you could see how mani you save which is nice i mean it realli kind of is a way of say wow you know this is what i didn't have laugh
236	c: right a lot of peopl find themselv in that posit like you just discuss in that they have a choic that they want to make but sometim it hard to realli have in your head
237	c: you know and that is that when peopl tri to make realli big chang all at onc sometim they do feel that way
238	c: yeah plan ahead is a realli a lot of peopl find that veri valuabl and it ?
239	c: if you drink yeah close if you drink four cup a day so not over a week becaus that wouldn't be that much right but four cup everi day of these drink and a cup is right like this mayb you know so most peopl drink like this right ? but if you drink four of these a day that about a pound yeah you got it and so that also mean the opposit right that if you cut out four cup a day that would be that would also be a pound tri to think if i have a pictur of a cup a cup is about a basebal or a tenni ball so it sometim smaller than peopl think
240	c: sure i sure can so some peopl find that when they go into a fast food restaur and they'r realli hungri they'r go to order more and they might eat more than they would if they had plan ahead so that might be one exampl of be extra hungri and not plan ahead some peopl find that if they'r with certain peopl they order differ thing and those might be healthier or unhealthi choic
241	c: where do you think you might put a remind that would be most like to be effect ?
242	c: i have some idea i can share with you if you want to hear them
243	c: if you would like me to i have a sheet i can show you that talk about how long to work out so this you'r go to get all of these sheet to take home but this sheet right here i think speak to exact what you were talk about that is that if you were to work out three day a week with a goal of get up to 60 minut of high intens workout that like where your heart realli pound and mayb it difficult for you to talk when you'r work out realli hard becaus you have to take so mani breath so the recommend is to start here with stretch to add in some strength but the big piec is to add in the 60 minut of what they call aerob exercis three day a week there are some exampl sever of which you mention
244	c: a lot of peopl do the thing that you mention they chang what they eat or how they eat they chang their activ level in some way to help with weight loss
245	c: okay if you'd like me to i have a coupl of sheet in here that i can show you that might be help to keep track
246	c: so i think it this bottom sheet yep so here someth that might be help this is call a physic activ log and it doe more than track your physic activ you can use it to track how much tv you watch so for exampl let see today is tuesday for exampl if you were to circl one tv for everi 30 minut that you watch today then mayb you could make a goal for yourself to do someth a littl differ the next day
247	c: okay so would it be worth mayb look at a coupl other of these handout and see if anyth appeal to you ?
248	c: so mayb pictur like if you were just stroll down the street not realli tri to walk fast that would be mild or easi intens if you were kind of walk the way you do when you have to go to class not that you'r late for class but just you have to get to your next class and you don't want to be late that would probabl be moder or medium activ and if you were realli late and you were just book it like as fast as you could that would be high intens workout to where you get to the point where you can probabl feel your chest pound so okay and then let see these are some food one yeah the rest of these are food let see your choic that i have in here are i don't know if this is appeal to you or if this would work for you and your famili but there these some of these might be a littl young for you although there boy and girl club for older peopl here ymca and healthi live detroit these are just some place that sometim peopl go to work out if they you know are in a posit where they can get to these place and you know 0:11:47 the membership fee which is pretti low compar to like if you were to join a fit club it would be veri veri high but these are more afford
249	c: you know but there might also be some other peopl that you might want to you know 0:23:32 to ask and you know if there were some good resourc out there
250	c: not in this build necessarili but if you'd like i might be abl to look up some resourc and mayb give you a list of place that you could check out for how to stay activ
251	c: sometim when i work with peopl some peopl like to pick one littl thing that they can do that small but they'r go to do it on a regular basi so they get realli you know good at it that way and they'll just kind of chip away at the weight and other time when i work with peopl they you know realli want to have like you know big goal or they want to you know lot of other thing
252	c: has your doctor given you inform about that ?
253	c: i think you know one of the thing i'v learn anyway is that peopl sometim feel that they have a big challeng and that they want to be at the level of do the box right away
254	c: okay alright so well you know some peopl find that it realli help to come up with a plan for what they would like to do and you'v start to talk about a plan alreadi like "i have to do a coupl step first befor i can do boxing" or mayb it nutrit that you'r interest in chang
255	c: mm-hmm yeah so some peopl set a goal for themselv where they say "you know i'v alreadi tri cut down on sugar" and they don't realli have that much now "so i think that i'm go to tri eat fewer calori per meal or smaller portions" other peopl might say "you know i feel like i could have more fruit and veget in my diet and so mayb that what i should focus on first"
256	c: yeah ? is that the reason that i'm ask is i'm wonder if that someth you would like to focus on improv or if you feel like you'r alreadi do well enough in that area and mayb there someth differ relat to eat that you'd like to focus on
257	c: okay great so i'm tri to think if i have some thing in here that we might look at if that okay it might give you some idea let see here so you'r talk a lot about sugar in particular i guess if you want to make some chang in that area here are some idea that might be help to you so some peopl decid we'll start with this one some peopl decid that one thing to cut down on is sugar in your drink okay so they might just choos to make a chang like mayb not drink pop or fruit juic as much for exampl and so you can see here although this isn't just sugar calori are an import part of what will help you with weight loss fewer calori mean less weight okay anoth idea and this one a littl bit differ too this isn't necessarili sugar but it calori
258	c: okay so this one might not be as help to you but this idea is basic if you were to eat out or eat these kind of food at home here are healthi choic versus unhealthi choic you get the choic between the two
259	c: here anoth one and this might be relev for sugar- relat this help with portion size mean how much of a serv you have at one time and so if for exampl you did have a sugari food or your mind told you you want one food but you tri to say "you know i think i'm just go to toss it off or have someth else" this might be a way to you to get at that is think about how much food you have at each serv and that way it might not be the case that you alway have to say "you know no i'm not go to have anyth right now" you might just choos to have a differ size and the last thing that we might think about work on today in a plan for you is just keep track of what you eat so that you can see better where you could make some help chang so some peopl find it realli help to write down like the day and time that they eat even if it just a snack and what they eat and there some other categori here that might be help but probabl the next most import one is how mani calori the food has
260	c: okay okay well let me put these away for now and you'r go to get these to take home with you becaus it may be the case that onc you get good at do this you might decid you want to do one of these other thing too
261	c: okay i do have one that we can use if you'd like to take a look at it see this is a blank one you and i would have to either fill it out or talk through it basic this is a littl plan that we have to help peopl put their idea down on paper or at least put them in their head and so what we could do is decid what your plan is that you'd like to do and you mention log and learn how to count calori we talk about whi it is import to you that you write that down and then an import part is know what the barrier might be mean know what could stop you from be abl to use your plan
262	c: alrighti so you have an import goal and you have an import reason for do your goal or for tri to achiev your goal now what about this part ? no matter how much somebodi want to do someth there could be thing that could make it difficult or that could even stop them from do it
263	c: so for some peopl they might be in a rush or have someth els to do and so they don't have time to do their log so that would be one thing that could get in the way it might not alway but sometim it could
264	c: and i hear these thing a lot from peopl that if they'r go to get slow down by someth those are the kind of thing that will make it difficult for them to reach their goal
265	c: okay if i could make one suggest would that be okay ? so some peopl find that when they start to run out of patienc that if they keep work that they realli realli run out of patienc and so sometim it okay just to set it asid for a minut and say "you know what ? i'm just get upset here i'm go to take a break for about five minut and then come back and tri again" and they might even just ask somebodi to help them so you could say like for exampl
266	c: you might say "mom i'm have a realli hard time figur out the calori in this meal can you help me" ? and those might be help thing
267	c: anytim peopl make big chang it doe take a lot of people; it harder to do on your own than it is when you have lot of peopl help you
268	c: i don't i might be abl to find one for you though so mayb befor you leav i can tri to look one up on the internet and print it out for you
269	c: you know becaus when peopl think about whether or not they want to lose weight that general one of the reason they think about is whether they'r healthi or not
270	c: well would it be help if you look in a chart to see where your weight is compar to other peopl your age ? okay so you know that they weigh you in the other room befor you came in here and they calcul out where you fall compar to other young ladi your age and let see
271	c: okay so just to kind of remind you of how they work the green area is the area for averag weight so it would be healthi weight this area is overweight this is underweight and this red area is obes okay ?
272	c: and a lot of time when i meet with peopl we go ahead and write down a littl bit of a plan in term of what they'd like to do to kind of keep up with their you know or think about weight loss or work on it
273	c: no ? okay so i have a coupl thing in here i can show you if that would help to give you some idea on what you might do okay we have these littl handout and you'r go to get all of these but we'r just go to look at a coupl of them for now let see so when peopl want to think about you know and make plan for the way that they are activ here are a coupl thing that they usual think about one is keep track of what you do becaus you you know like anybodi would probabl have a tough time rememb everi day like what specif you did and for how long you did it and like if you watch tv or play on the comput or anyth like that how long did you do that ? caus that time that you'r not activ you know ? so one way to keep track of your activ is to use a log like this one or you could make your own where like each day of the week you write down what kind of exercis you did or activ you had how long and whether it was easi moder mean medium or vigor activ so like softbal when you play and you like ran the base and you ran you know from the outfield to the infield and that that would be like vigor activ if you did that for about 20 to 30 minut or so or longer easi activ would be kind of like like if you walk around the block and mayb you walk kind of fast but it that would be easi activ and then moder activ might be someth like jog in place or run slowli or walk quick would be anoth exampl and then some peopl find it help to keep track of how long they do thing that involv like sit down and not be activ okay anoth option is to just set a goal for yourself to say okay you know what ? three day a week i'm go to work up to the point where i'm do 60 minut each of those day of high intens activ and aerob activ is this kind of stuff like run or kickbox danc that kind of thing and then on top of it you know stretch and strengthen would be in addit to that if you want to do that okay ?
274	c: this paper right here a lot of peopl find it help to kind of keep their thought organ and have a plan that they can turn to whenev they forget or want to remind themselv of what they'r do and so we could either talk through this or we could write it down whatev would be best for you but a lot of peopl say okay you know "i'm go to make my plan for myself and mayb your plan would be i'm go to exercis three day a week and work up to 60 minutes" you might have a differ idea in mind that you want to start with we'd also tri to figur out whi that import to you in other word what is your motiv for want to do that ? what would you get out of it ? okay and then we would spend a littl bit of time talk about what could get in your way and stop you from reach your goal and what to do about that so that you can reach your goal and we can also talk about what to do when you leav here today and who could help you
275	c: you could pick a time you could pick like how mani day of the week you could pick the kind of exercis anyth that you feel like would be a good goal for yourself that would help with weight loss
276	c: yeah some peopl find it help to ask anoth person to like check up on them or mayb they write note to themselv to kind of motiv like you know rememb that you just are just go to do it or you know like the nike commerci that say just do it ? some peopl stick like littl post it note around the hous laugh so
277	c: okay so that might be one thing you might think of as a possibl solut like if it becom a problem then you could keep track
278	c: okay the reason that i'm say so much about this is becaus a lot of peopl do feel like they can just go ahead and do thing that they said like they set a goal for themselv and they say you know what ? if i don't feel like do it i'm just go to do it anyway and that may be true most of the time but everi onc in a while you might run into a time when it realli hard to get past that and do it anyway and so that what i'm tri to help you with right now is a plan for what if you have one of those day where laugh where it is hard you know  ?
279	c: that kind of an idea of you know peopl have an easier time be success when they have other peopl help them in some way or when they can at least turn to anoth person when they need help
280	c: okay so 100% fruit juic is a good idea in term of healthier vitamin and stuff like that but from a calori standpoint it still go to be the same number of calori
281	c: yeah and there are like diet drink also that don't have calori but you know some peopl don't like drink a lot of those becaus they'r still sweet and have chemic but at least there are no calori
282	c: well i have i have some thought so mayb can i share those with you and you can let me know what you think ?
283	c: and also the activ so sometim when i meet with peopl they want to talk about you know like differ thing that they want to tri do like they'v heard about like just some differ thing with weight loss or a new activ or they want to hear more about differ way to eat we can talk about that stuff or we can realli talk about what you'r alreadi do right now and how well it been work and talk about how you can kind of stick with that
284	c: now a lot of time when i meet with peopl they put togeth a littl bit of a plan would you want to take a look at how that might go ?
285	c: and a lot of time when i'm work with peopl you know i kind of find that make realli specif goal like the smaller they are the more specif the more help they can be for some peopl
286	c: okay i mean some kid say thing like energi or look differ or other health benefit
287	c: i have a littl inform in here about portion size you know what would be a serv would that be someth you'd want to take a look at ?
288	c: like a tenni ball or a basebal so meat is actual one thing you kind of just you ask me about the fri chicken would you want to talk a littl bit more about how to look at the fri chicken in term of use these ?
289	c: there other inform in this in this folder and we don't have to talk about all of it
290	c: so you want to take a peek at what in here ?
291	c: so this is talk about the stuff about what you'r drink becaus just like you had alreadi said that you'd made chang to what you'r have to drink it give you a littl bit more inform about differ type of beverag so it on this page and that page and it talk about you know have differ choic and healthier choic
292	c: all right so this one talk about activ on how to kind of give you an idea of how mani minut a day for a goal and how you might break it down between aerob strength and stretch
293	c:  : and this page is talk about some resourc around the detroit area for differ class on nutrit or activ
294	c: so let some teen find it help to just fill out a plan so that when you do leav here and after you sleep you can still rememb what we talk about
295	c: well i have some inform about what call your bodi mass index or your bmi would that be someth you'd want to take a look at i could explain ?
296	c: so would you want to take a look at that stuff under bodi mass index ?
297	c: your bodi mass index or your bmi it actual a measur of somebodi height to their weight and it let you know what your diseas risk is in relat to your weight
298	c: this is just the remind to yourself about you know kind of to motiv yourself
299	c: well sometim when peopl come in and talk to me they talk to me about stuff that they'r alreadi do or that they'v heard their famili talk about like chang in nutrit or be more activ and other time they look at some inform that i have and they get some idea from there
