57	c: okay so you have lot of idea in term of place to go that you can get fresher food as oppos to go with more of the fast food and you have some thought about cut down on the fri food like fri chicken at home what are some thing
58	c: so you realli have kind of assess the situat and your mom not realli the best person to talk to about that and your friend your best friend live across town so you don't get to see him veri frequent
59	c: so find that person to you know kind of hang out with and to be more activ with and to cut down on the eat when you'r bore sound like the thing that you'r realli look for right now and you'r have troubl come up with who that person could be and you mention peopl around the complex but you don't realli know then veri well and your mom out and other member of the famili might not fit with what you'r look for either
60	c: those type of thing are realli stop you from kind of get out of the hous and do less of the tv and the comput stuff and you see that that one way that you can realli work on stop the eat when you'r bore now you mention that your grandma realli has kind of been tough on you about your weight

62	c: and then this idea of watch how much time you'r inact you'v kind of suggest schedul thing and that
63	c: so you keep come back to this idea of find activ thing to do and you know you have the summer school stuff that take up a lot of your time and then now you start with the band
64	c: okay so it realli this idea that you'r readi for some chang to move forward all right and find that thing is kind of the tough part you know make the decis on what to do and what to stick through

71	c: okay great so ad some veggi in is someth you'r think about you'r will to take a look at a handout that talk about that and you'v been just total do great with the footbal stuff it you know import to you to kind of stick with that becaus you'r realli good at it and it fun
72	c: yeah well you know you'v mention physic activ and you'v mention nutrit as two area you know that you'v thought about one is about the food choic and one is about just be activ in sport
73	c: okay so you this is someth you realli want to do and you realli want to make a chang but you'r worri that this sort of dramat like huge thing is not someth you can accomplish right now and you'v alreadi said you'v tri and tri and tri so mani thing and it doesn't work and mayb you'r on to someth mayb make some small chang might have more success
74	c: so it sound like you mayb you know that 500 calori you can cut by cut food but you can also burn by get more activ so what you'r say is mayb it would be better to do like a littl bit of each you know like cut back a littl bit of food like cut out juic or mayb a littl bit smaller portion at dinner but then also be a littl bit more activ at the same time so that you'r burn at the same time but you also don't want to like work out at a gym you want to kind of more just like go outsid for a walk or just mayb or mayb watch less-sit around less is what you'r say ?
75	c: so walk and the wii and it sound like it someth that you want to tri to incorpor a littl everyday you know instead of like a big huge workout plan but mayb just a littl bit everyday you know would fit better for you alright and you mention the juic cut out juic
76	c: so it not realli a matter of the fact that like you can't handl that activ for that long so again just find the right thing for you well you know a lot of time you had mention actual one thing a lot of time peopl do and that go on the internet to look around for thing
77	c: okay okay and so pre-pack the chip in small portion is someth that sound like small portion of chip and that someth your mom can do which is have that food avail ?

80	c: i mean your famili also will be happi but you want to be happier you want to feel better physic and emot and you'v identifi some small chang that you could make that might make a differ bring food from home when you go to work or school down the road or what have you smaller portion of the unhealthi thing like the chip get up at eight o'clock to be activ and pack food and set your alarm and those are all kind of small thing that you think you can do right now
81	c: okay so for you number is just not realli what you'r look at you just want to drop some weight and feel better becaus you want to be healthier and you'v alreadi made some chang
82	c: you do okay so it not just an idea that someon told you this is someth you actual realli enjoy okay
83	c: you'v alreadi made chang with the walk and it seem like you'r pretti confid about keep that up and now you'd like to make some chang with your nutrit eat more fruit and veget and replac high fat and high calori meal with salad are sort of two area that you think would make a big differ
84	c: okay so just to summar you you'v thought about this alreadi i mean this is none of this is new this is someth you'v want to do for a long time and you'v alreadi made some reall;i great chang i mean walk everi day is a huge thing and you'r commit to it when you set your mind to someth you do it
85	c: so you'r kind of catch yourself with the portion too you'r choos healthi food your mom you know cook them for you she cook healthier
86	c: all right well what i'm hear is is that you know you'r pretti motiv to make this happen and you have some good reason whi you want to make it happen and you'v tri a coupl thing but you'r just not 100% sure whether you'v been do the best thing
87	c: alright well so we'v had some time to kind of talk a lot about you know nutrit and you'v come up with some idea as far as the drink and chang portion but you'r not quit sure about what you know what you want to do or what the thing is go to be that go to get you work on that a littl bit more
88	c: all right cool well it sound like you'r kind of at a point where you'r still decid what you want to do and you'v got some idea as far as the eat and you know drink of differ thing
89	c: 19:56 so kind of around activ it sound like find someth would be pretti help becaus you'r interest in stay excit and do someth mayb a coupl time a week
90	c: but you also are notic that you'r at a weight that get in your way you know and that there thing that you want to do that you know other kid can do that you can't and so it more it not so much you think it import but you'r just not sure like how to go about it ?
91	c: yeah so you'v notic that there a coupl of thing you'r say to me one is that you have friend that aren't true friend becaus they make fun of you and that just they shouldn't be do that either way but you'r also you know notic that you know becaus of where you'r at with your weight that you'r avoid situat and you'r mayb becom less social and you don't want it to be that way
92	c: cand you'v notic that people-you'r feel like peopl treat you differ and what you'v tri so far is exercis and you like it i mean you actual your face kind of lit up when you said it and it someth that you enjoy but when your uncl left then it you know it stop and it hasn't start back up again and so that one area that you'r consid a chang is to think about how to get more activ and you even notic that not onli did you feel good but you start to lose some weight
93	c: okay so you'r recogn that you want to eat less and less fatti food and you'r worri caus school is veri tempt but you'r also recogn that even if you mess up at school there also home and so you'r think about with your mom and you call her your mom that with your mom that make some chang kind of as a team might be the way to go ?
