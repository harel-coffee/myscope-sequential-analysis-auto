156	cg: i mean he be up at the store just be load up laugh yeah be load up but when we was like differ place on our own mm-hmm we never i didn't buy all that uh-uh 1:32:40 if i bought it i bought it becaus you know like it had a ten cent deposit you know it can add up you can cash in and stuff like that but when you get to drink that stuff after for a while that stuff be so strong you be like oh you know so yeah
157	cg: yeah it hard to break those
158	cg: it hard veri hard
159	cg: i mean at home it okay becaus i know i can control the portion and becaus i do all the cook and i can control the salt intak and all of that but it like onc she goe to school her choic you know becaus of her friend she want to fit in with the crowd and when she goe to visit with my mom my mom doesn't restrict her from anyth or his grandpar or anyth like that so it like when she leav home her decis are like realli not good
160	cg: yeah becaus i be scare like if we go for too long of a walk that her knee go to pop and we be too far from home to get her there without be in so much pain and then she doesn't like too mani sport i mean she an art and craft hands-on type person she not a realli outgo
161	cg: caus i don't want it to be like where she has to-becaus we stay in an area where we can realli walk you know it has park and stuff like that but i don't want her to be like on verner and central and we stay on michigan and illinoi and that a way it too long to get her home without her be in extrem pain so
162	cg: okay see but then i have to worri about her eczema dri her out too much so it like she got this well we can do this but if we do too much it like she go too-so i have to find that balanc somehow
163	cg: right in the summer time i let her go i make sure she stay moistur but it doesn't like toward the end when it get realli humid and it doesn't work she alway end up dri out so we had to stop her from go to the pool a lot and that kind of slow put her back on the couch with the video game and the tv so
164	cg: yeah becaus i tell her instead of go to now and later get a fruit snack or get some fruit or just a granola bar or someth and she like granola i buy granola we buy fruit snack and thing like that to chang the candi and it like instead of potato chip get sun chip or someth like that but it when she in the crowd of peopl she like no i'm not go to get the fruit snack i'm go to get the now and later and the chocol candi bar and she like to spend-i mean then she doesn't like the-when she has money she like to go to the store and i don't like to tell her no too much becaus i know-i think it just me i think i'm the problem realli
165	cg: yeah becaus they work so hard in school and then i know they have to like be outsid on the bus earli in the morn and they need just that littl bit of energi and pick me up and i know it easi to grab a pack of skittl or someth the sugar rush to keep you go so caus i did it when i was a kid so it was like i can't say no
166	cg: and that i know is a lot they do eat more becaus they'r bore and just sit around i notic that they do go in the kitchen a lot when there realli noth to do
167	cg: yeah now i'm not realli good at the calori count thing and watch calori becaus i don't know exact if i'm do the right exact portion i know a fist of pasta is all you'r suppos to have but i'm like i have big hand so laugh
168	cg: they'r alway like "it too watery" and i'm like "okay tri the 2%"
169	cg: right and i think it more so and also she tri to keep up with my son she feel that whatev he can eat she can eat and it not you know and i had to you know in the begin becaus i was a contribut factor to it becaus it was just like i didn't want to caus mayb i felt like i was do favorit if i let him have a whopper but you know he alway work out and stuff i felt bad becaus i didn't let you know he would have a tripl whopper you know but he would go work out you know he play footbal and this and that but then i would feel guilti if i didn't let her do it becaus i didn't want her to feel that i was play favorit "oh you know that your son you know i'm just a niec my mom"-so i think it was more guilt that i let a lot of it and then there it i just it just out of control
170	cg: you know and then you just realiz you know i'm like she just 12 the mental of a 12-year-old and sometim it get frustrat becaus you forget that she is onli 12 so
171	cg: right so and like i said i know they'r hungri by the time they get from school but it still you know it just you know too much and then also what they would do when i cook becaus i would do meatloaf i would do three meat but it would get us through the week so i don't have to come home and cook but dure the summer what i found out they were do was they would eat what for dinner for lunch and then turn around and eat it for dinner oh i see you know so i'm like no you have sandwich you know you have the turkey and you know they'r not sandwich eater you know my son will say anyth come out of a can it not real food you know he just

244	cg: : yeah i know that but a time log i would have it and it would probabl be scrap paper : honest it would be scrap paper becaus you know sometim you don't think about that you just go at the time go as your day goe you don't take time to necessarili "okay let me stop and look at this" and normal when i do look at my daili planner i look at it like two day befor so i can rememb what i have to do : for the rest of the week and sometim when i know i'v had a realli realli long day at night or midnight i'll look at my planner and okay "this is what i'v got to do" but it doesn't work like that; i'll just keep the whole list with me : that 49:45 just have a groceri list you know
245	cg: : it veri hard to get start caus by the time we get home like i said about five or six and sometim we might stop off at the librari becaus i do encourag read for her at least 30 minut to a hour a day so sometim we may go off and go to the librari i do my homework and she do her homework by the time we get home it oh about six o'clock mayb and we cook dinner and at one point we wasn't eat after seven but now sinc i'm work at school : yeah and it like realli hard for us not to eat after 7:00 for me to make dinner or someth like that and after you eat you'r tire you'r readi to go to sleep
246	cg: : yeah but it like i said that time manag i'm tri to just sit down and say "okay this is my time this is what i need to do; this is what i don't need to do" and tri to pick and choos what what and then i notic also where we'r alway on the go we'r snack eat : we'r stop to buy a bag of chip we'll stop and buy some donut and then we might not even eat dinner becaus we snack eat all day you know from the time she get out of school from three to six we ate so mani snacks-dinn we don't want anyth
247	cg: yeah i think that more so what it is and 52:48 like in the summer i notic like with the heat you know you get realli hot and you don't i tri not to eat the potato chip i had to start keep 52:58 granola bar and nutragrain bar in the car and stuff like that but that wasn't work too good

249	cg: mmm well to be honest i realli don't go by this becaus i don't think she obes
250	cg: accord to this i disagre
251	cg: i think she fall right here where they say but i just i i don't believ in i don't believ in where this who thought this may be the weight averag weight or where she should be becaus everybodi can't be here so i disagre with the whole thing this whole thing in general
