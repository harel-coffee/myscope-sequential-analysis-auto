119	c: okay and that an import thing for us to think about caus i wouldn't want to help you come up with a plan that you wouldn't be abl to do without somebodi els help so the last part of your plan is how somebodi could be support to you mean how they can help you be success and so we should choos somebodi who you feel like is around often enough
120	c: okay so let stick someth my aunt can do
121	c: well we have some time today to kind of talk about thing have to do with nutrit and activ
122	c: so at this point now you have a plan that you can take home with you and you can put it in some place where you might see it and rememb that this is someth import you said a seven out of ten import that you would like to work on it and you have some idea about how your aunt could help you so this is just one step this is one import chang that you would like to make it doesn't mean that there aren't other thing you might like to do too but this is the thing that you'v chosen as your goal okay ? at this point in a moment i'm gonna walk you out into the wait room and i'm gonna be with your aunt for a littl bit and i'm gonna help her come up with some idea too we can choos to share your plan if you would like to and if you would like to share it with your aunt we could do that in a coupl differ way you could either share it yourself when the two of you come back togeth or i could talk with it-with her a littl bit about it and then we could talk about it again when the two of you are togeth in the room
123	c: well you did some realli good work here i think you came up with a pretti good plan that fit with what you said you want to do and that was to work on chang to healthi eat
124	c: let me walk you out here okay ?
125	c: camera on and they'r noth to worri about; they look at both of us i usual just forget that they'r there and i also want to let you know that anyth you say to me is privat and confidenti mean that i won't tell peopl without your permiss except if you told me that you were in some kind of danger or put yourself or someon els or if you let me know that there an elder person or a child in some kind of troubl then i'd have to 0:27 that by law c it kind of has to be if you want to make some chang it got to be your idea  ?
126	c: so i guess you know mayb the first thing to do is just to talk a littl bit about what you think about your weight
127	c: well so tell-i guess you know if i was to help you in some way come up with some idea that you think might make a differ what kind of idea do you think that you and i might talk about ?
128	c: so mayb we could go back for just a minut to this idea that you'v done some thing at school that you feel like have made a differ
129	c: can i ask you not to write on the tabl
130	c: okay i have a littl sheet in here that we can use if that okay to write it down on ?
131	c: okay i'll give you someth to work on too huh ? laugh so whoop you know what ? i think i gave you the one that i would use for your mom here we go this one for the teen that you so this is just a plan that help peopl think about what kind of chang they would like to make and you mention that you would like to practic footbal more often and so you might say "mi plan is to" and then we can think about like how often do you think would be most help to you ? for two reason you mention you want to get better at play footbal and we also thought about practic more will help with weight too
132	c: so i'm go to make sure that you get this sheet so you can refer back to it later and make sure that you rememb some of the idea that we talk about okay ? so as far as your plan goe you had a plan to practic footbal more often
133	c: now here where we think about some of the thing that could get in the way and make it difficult for you to be abl to do that everi day and if we know what those are and we can plan how you might deal with them if they come then you'r more like to be abl to be success with your plan
134	c: okay so you could write that down
135	c: so mayb you could write that there as a remind "eat more fruit and veget becaus it will give me more energy"
136	c: okay then you see what the last line say ?
137	c: yeah so we should probabl think about it's-peopl general find that it a littl harder to do thing when they tri to do it all by themselv with nobodi help them so we want peopl to think a littl bit about who could help them who could be support to them

156	c: so we'v alreadi talk about a lot of this 16:25 this way you'v alreadi said that your plan is to use that long sheet and you'v alreadi said whi it import to you to do that we have a coupl of other thing that we could get down on paper here too if you think about you know what might stop you ? and the reason that i say that is that no matter how great of a plan somebodi has or no matter how motiv they are like you said you'r at an eight which is pretti high you know as far as your commit but even though you'r at an eight there might still be some stumbl block that could get in the way if you'r not prepar so mayb we could prepar ahead of time by say "well here are the thing that could stop me but this is what i'm go to do about them if they happen" we could say what the step you'll take is onc you leav here today to make your plan start work and then who you want to support you and what they could do
157	c: okay so you might start right here with what your plan is
158	c: okay so let see you said your plan is "to get down and start do more thing to help me and i want to do those becaus i want to lose it" so let see it might help if we say "if this get in the way"
159	c: so you might say "i'm go to be do more thing to help me such as not go to the store to buy chip and candi okay ? yeah just tuck it under
160	c: okay so now that we know that we have a veri detail plan about what specif chang you want to make right now now you can think more care about someth that could get in your way
161	c: okay okay so that actual probabl will fit better down here
162	c: so the last thing on your plan is peopl who can help you to reach your goal and you'v mention sever differ peopl as we'v been talk
163	c: okay alright so then you could put sister right there so it would read "someth my sister could do to help me reach my goal"
164	c: at this point what i'll do is in a moment i'll take you out into the other room and i think you have a coupl thing to do with the research assist who work with you earlier i'll talk with your mom for a few minut and then we'll all come togeth
165	c: so we have a chanc to kind of talk about either of them today
166	c: so what i'll do is i'll walk you out in the other room and i'll see you again in a few minut and i'll make sure you get your plan back at the end laugh
167	c: so i understand that you came to talk with us for a littl bit get a coupl of thing accomplish mayb so just befor we get start this is the part of our session where we turn on the video camera just so that you know okay and also i want to let you know that dure our time that we spend togeth we'll be talk about a few thing relat to weight loss and make some plan and i just want to let you know that anyth that you and i talk about is privat and confidenti unless you tell me that i can share inform or if you tell me that you'r go to hurt yourself or somebodi els or a child or an elder person is in troubl so those are just you know the standard kind of reason whi we wouldn't keep inform privat so alrighti
168	c: yep so you know i guess the other thing just to to let you know how today will go is that you and i will spend about 20 minut togeth then i'll spend about 20 minut with your mom
169	c: and you know we can get start just by talk about what you think about your weight
170	c: well and earlier do you mind if i put this away ?
171	c: okay okay and i'm go to send all of these home with you so just becaus you say that this might be a good place to start doesn't mean that you can't add ani of these other
172	c: yeah great okay so i'm go to just stick these away so that they'r not
173	c: yeah well i have a plan that if you would like to take a look at you know it kind of a skeleton plan but you can kind of fill in what you might want to focus on and whi that kind of thing would you
174	c: now some peopl take a look at this plan and they decid that what would work best for them would be just to talk about it and other peopl decid they realli would just want to have a written plan they can take home and put up somewher as a remind so this is what our plan look like
175	c: okay so i mean you'v kind of had a chanc to look over the plan and if it okay i'll just tell you a littl bit about each of the piec of it so usual what peopl find valuabl is to come up with a a small part of their plan so like your big goal might be to lose a certain amount of weight but this plan might be the first step you'r go to take and you mention work out and you mention also cut out some fast food calori so you might pick one of those to focus on initi and then you would write down what your plan is like and then you would say whi you want to do it so what are your person motiv for want to do that particular stuff ? ani good plan involv plan ahead for problem that come up as you probabl know from school yep so we would tri to identifi the major problem that might get in your way and develop a plan in case they come up so that you'll have someth readi you can just look at your chart and say exact yep and then this is an import part too i think you know is just have in mind what the veri first thing that you can do when you leav here today to get start in work toward your plan ? and then final a section on social support becaus it so much easier to do a plan and be success when you have somebodi who there to support you or help you in some way so we alway encourag peopl to kind of get some other involv and so
176	c: yep and so we might just say like what specif you would ask her to do for exampl
177	c: yep and then the small one after
178	c: well if you would like to i can help you come up with a plan for work on fast food and then you'll have someth you can walk away with today in hand to get you start
179	c: yeah and that what i'm here to help you with
180	c: well you know you did mention some thing earlier that if it would help you we can talk through a littl bit and then you can make a choic
181	c: right right and other thing might occur to you over time too like now that this is on your mind and you have a plan for what you want to do you might discov thing that you hadn't realli notic befor you know as you'r pay more attent to what you'r do in a fast food restaur so unless you have other particular barrier that you want to list on there we can think of some thing that you can do to prevent these from stop you laugh
182	c: and then a coupl thing relat to like the the thought that you have and the remind like the physic remind that you want to come up with and you know as i'm look at your list right here i'm see you know someth that could be realli use to you if you feel comfort
183	c: yep exact so okay well if you don't have ani question about what we talk about in the plan that you came up with what i'd like to do now is i'll i'll take you in the other room and i will meet with your mom for a littl bit and i'm go to talk with her about some of the same thing that you and i talk about and see how she might be support to you and we can share your plan with her in a coupl differ way if you want to we can either do it when the two of you come back togeth if you would like to talk over your plan with your mom you may if you don't want to that fine too if you want me to share it with her befor we come togeth as a group that okay too okay and would it be okay if i actual show her your plan ?
