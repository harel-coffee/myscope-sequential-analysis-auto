528	t: mmm noth realli i think you basic like hit the major point of what we was talk about so i'll say that what you said is realli like all we need to talk with her about
529	t: i like that approach ask instead of just say "you should do this" or "you should do that" it make me feel better if you would suggest thing that i can do that i like to do instead of just say "oh you should do this" or "you go do that" or "eat this or
530	t: i have high confid but at time i get down about my weight like i know i should lose weight for myself becaus i'm onli 16 and it not healthi to be the weight that i am so me be the size that i am i can't it some thing i can't do like regular teenag my age so i would like to lose weight but it was like and sometim i think "oh i can't do it" or "it go to be too hard" and i'll just say "forget about it" and i just don't want to do it at all so like late like this summer i decid that i want to lose weight for myself and i'm go to tri what i need to do to lose weight
531	t: like some kid they go out more like it teen club or whatev now and sometim i'm like oh i'm not go to go becaus peopl may say smart remark to me or whatev and it may be conflict so i'm just go to sit at home and just watch tv or someth
532	t: it hurt my feel
533	t: like caus we eat a lot of fruit and veget like i don't-w don't eat that much caus like i just late i haven't realli had much of an appetit especi dure the summer we don't realli eat-i mean just like 20:43 fruit and veget becaus it like i like to eat we might have like realli good meal like mayb onc a week it like too much and sometim don't realli eat that much like we alway like we have chip or whatev like i said we main have fruit and veget
534	t: i know that i'm onli 16 and i'm more than 300 pound which is not good at all so and i'm go to get older so when i get older it a possibl that i can gain weight and i don't want to gain the weight at all i want to lose the weight so gain weight will put me at a less advantag of my futur and my health caus i want to grow older and get marri and have kid and stuff
535	t: when i went to the doctor about a month ago it was 315 and today it 321 and i wasn't satisfi with that becaus it like i gain what six pound and that not good in a month that not good
536	t: c: okay
537	t: i'v tri the food intak stuff and dure the school year it veri hard becaus the school that i go to i go to cas tech and they sell chicken and bosco stick and all this other food and it so tempt that you buy it and it like you eat the food there and then you go home and you eat the same food so it like "oh well i guess i'll eat this again caus it here and it easier" whatev so now my mommi and i we'r tri to get on a diet and not eat the fast food and the fatten food that we eat and stuff and we eat tv dinner that are like smart one and stuff like that so we could watch our food intak and stuff
538	t: and we sometim be like go to fast food although we might have fast food like twice a month some peopl it like not enough becaus it like our godsist they eat that all they eat is fast food and it like that it and they like don't get it they eat fruit and they get sick they realli had to go to the hospit it was weird laugh i thought it was funni they were scare becaus they didn't know what was go on they had a salad and they got sick and we were just-i just laugh the whole time it was just so funni
539	t: i can start caus it a treadmil in my home i can start walk on the treadmil or we have on the tv they have like littl a place you can go on demand they have yoga and stuff like that becaus yoga i like yoga too like i'v never went to like a class at like a place but it seem like i'll like it and it a lot of mental stabilit in yoga and i realli like it
540	t: it like laugh that i'm like okay mayb i'm go to just stick with the veget becaus like yeah like that all they do is eat and that doesn't happen to most peopl i'm like think it best to stick with veget and that it laugh

604	t: yeah becaus that was like last year i wasn't as big i was in cheerlead and she said if you don't want to get you know way too big you can cut down on some of the portion of your food and your water and it get you full we had stop cheerlead becaus our cheerlead coach had had a babi and then we didn't have anoth coach to teach us
605	t: i don't know if they got it back though

615	t: yeah like the pop like we drink caffein free pepsi and actual like the way that one tast better than pepsi with caffein like you can tast 27:03 or someth and it better
616	t: probabl like if i see it i probabl don't want it as much as i do now becaus like usual i be like snap cake right there i'm go to eat it but now i just be like uh there cake right there mayb i'll just get a littl piec and go outsid but i don't like cake it right there becaus like my aunti she real real like real skinni like real boni and she keep cake in her hous and i'll go over to her hous and i usual don't eat the cake now usual i'll be like snap cake right there laugh let me eat it but usual i don't eat it now

1013	t: yeah that what i was say when i was at the gym when i'v been sinc i'v been go to the gym i'v been tell myself like i'm go to get out of this stage of have a burger and then go to the gym or eat someth that fatter that what i need to eat but i just have to like push myself like i realli want to do this so i have to get in that mind frame where this is what you want to do if you want to do it you have to go out and get it so that what i'm tri to get myself in that predica like just no just to say no
1014	t: becaus you'r so use to do the other- the opposit of what you'r tri to bring into yep
1015	t: i just say go for it like tri your hardest to stay in the mind frame of do right and make yourself better and make yourself healthi if you stay in that mind frame then you will be abl to go on and do what you want to do but if it just like too overwhelm for you to do and you just go back to the fattier food then you don't realli have too much control over yourself laugh and you'r be control by everyth els realli
1016	t: i think just start out with the small like small like i said i start go to the gym first and if i start see if i'm not realli see ani result from go to the gym then i know i need to focus on my food and the gym and tri to like weigh them both at the same time and yeah like i said time or someth go to the gym or i'm go to eat this after i come from the gym or befor i go to the gym just make a plan for yourself basic
1017	t: like my stepdad he talk to me about it he be like he be like you could die from it you could have a heart attack and all that but like he say it so much to the point like as like when he said it to me he normal say that he be make fun of it but now that he said it like sometim i take it serious and sometim i don't becaus like how do i know you not play and he a good actor so
1018	t: we can do that yeah
1019	t: i think i would write it down and go over it and then tri to get myself to do it befor i'm just go to say okay i'm just go to take this plan it go to be done you have to look over someth first to get it in your head that this is what you want to do like i said befor so i think just read it over first and then take it step by step on what i want to do to get to the next part
1020	t: like i said i have my older sister go with me to the gym and stuff like that
1021	t: my overal goal i think i want to lose about i'd say 30 pound about 30 pound thirti pound
1022	t: and my plan after that is like basic i alreadi start my plan by go to the gym but i also want to like i said get rid of the fast food so i think yeah it to cut out that fast food that realli the big problem like the gym it not a it not a big like i can go whenev i want becaus i have this membership now
1023	t: so but the food that the big problem that the big issu
1024	t: alright we can do that yeah
1025	t: well he most say it like like if he just got done drink like on father day i mean not father day the day when the basketbal game had came on he was drink like he done brung it up so i look at him like "ain't nobodi in the mood to play whi you talk to me about this"
1026	t: basic just to cut down on it yeah to cut down i'm not go to say i'm go to complet get fast food out of my life caus i know that not go to happen but just to cut back a littl bit on it not eat it as much as i do now but just cut down a littl bit on it
1027	t: to cut down it to like basic i just want to not eat so much of it in one day mayb have like one meal from a fast food restaur or probabl like three time a week or someth like that just get a plan on like how mani time to eat it or you know stuff like that i have to like realli think about like a real plan to like cut down on it instead of just say cut down on it
1028	t: i mean like the plan would be to like basic it to choos the healthier side of thing to get more healthier basic you have to improv your health becaus you know like differ sick can come from eat fast food or be obes or someth like that
1029	t: to improv health laugh yeah
1030	t: mmm mayb your conscienc laugh mayb your conscienc could be one
1031	t: mayb your focus could get in the way of that the focus of just stick to your plan
1032	t: like they tell me like they be like "malik you need" as like my grandma she tell me sometim like "malik you look like you slim down" which is i have becaus like all of my cloth feel a lot bigger and like when i was around like 230 like last summer i went to the doctor i was like almost like 242 or someth like that and like sinc i did that i been run around cut grass all of that so like i guess it all add up like all of my cloth like sometim i use to be abl to just fold down the top of them but now they still come out
1033	t: right yeah i think all of it is just basic keep the plan in mind that you keep in your focus basic in a good mindset that you have a plan and that you'r you have a goal basic
1034	t: i think i'm go to have it somewher written down laugh to actual rememb like okay you know or just have self control i think that would be one
1035	t: 33:01 a remind
1036	t: in my phone in my cell phone yep becaus you know it when my phone ring i'm just like where is it ? so i think my phone would be i'll just put phone
1037	t: yeah i guess 0:34:03 i'll put famili too i think that all that can come to me right now
1038	t: right so my first step could be is to keep this in mind when i'm go to get someth to eat caus i know i'm go to go get someth to eat when i leav becaus mom said she was hungri earlier so i guess just keep my plan in mind will be my first step
1039	t: i think i would ask my- right now today i think my mom would be who i would ask becaus she is go to be the one buy food laugh
1040	t: just to help just basic help me stay focus on what i'm tri to do encourag me
1041	t: hmm mayb like if she would say someth like do you think that healthi ? or rememb your plan or someth like that i'm sure she would say someth if she know that i realli want to do this she go to say someth to help i'm not exact sure what she would say but i'm sure she would say someth if she know that i'm tri to do someth and she see me slack a littl bit or someth
1042	t: oh yeah she alway support alway
1043	t: i think i'll be abl to do it i just have to push myself becaus it someth i want so yeah i think i can do it
1044	t: i think i'm at about a six about a six
1045	t: well becaus it was like this had alreadi been like in my mind that i want to get healthier so by me do this plan it just made me think a littl bit more on what i should do instead of just like okay i'm just go to work out and that just go to be it becaus i know that don't that doesn't alway help if you'r work out and then you'r leav and you'r go to get some burger or someth so yeah i think that just just gave me a littl push
1046	t: actual practic and plan and and tri some step to get more into it just practic it
1047	t: like just run around a lot and play manhunt hide and seek and tag and all of the other stuff
1048	t: it'll be a part of my day or my life or someth like that
1049	t: it a part of me
1050	t: i mean my mom she tri to motiv me to work out but it-i need somebodi that go to make me she tri to make me but i end up stop i need somebodi that go to need to just like as if it was my school work or someth somebodi that go to push me to it becaus she was tri to make me do it and it would start hurt so i stop

1052	t: at least 125 if it
1053	t: the thing that my mom do she got the exercis that she do they let-'caus she slim down so i would want to keep with that

1090	t: my best friend becaus when she was over my hous she was like "come on let do yoga" and my best friend i call her my sister destini
1091	t: becaus when peopl ask me they like "do you want some candy" ? befor i even say no she like "don't ask her no more"
1092	t: like inaud and then she when she buy me stuff from the store she make sure she check the calori the everyth

1095	t: i'm go to show her too
1096	t: i mean i'm still activ but like like i just don't do the same like i'll say out of a hundr i do like 60% of what i do at home
1097	t: you could share it with her
1098	t: you can show it to her
1099	t: i'll leav it here
1100	t: and like at home like we don't realli play for team like footbal team and that like we all boy and like ain't none of us scare to get hurt break a bone or anyth so like we go down the street and we play tackl and stuff
1101	t: there was a point when i was like i was with my father you know kind of it was stuff go on with him and you know how peopl can get stress out and eat and stuff i use to do that a lot a lot but like for the past two to three month you know i haven't been with him kinda left that out left it out but sinc then i been to the doctor found out you know i had to lose someth i'm on a diet i'v been do good
1102	t: they exercis cardio and all that stuff i actual have no choic but to do cardio 0:02:45 in gym so so it not that
1103	t: i don't eat a lot i don't necessarili you know even though i have gym i just you know my parent still tri to they don't believ me do that so they still tri to do some at home i walk but that pretti much it it and i'v been eat fruit and veget i'm not realli eat that much so that the onli thing i do know that can help me with my weight but that not work obvious
1104	t: mm-hmm but like at my grandma i can still like throw the ball and then test my run to see how fast i can catch the ball and stuff and plus i notic that i lost weight becaus it was like like i never been abl to jump as high as i can now
1105	t: i might say my sleep mayb
1106	t: i'm veri interest in it
1107	t: just to live a long life becaus somebodi liter younger than me die caus of their weight
1108	t: and so and he was onli 15 so
1109	t: yeah i would have to have me die from anyth
1110	t: i guess the less tv and i bare even do that i know it not the food caus like becaus of me we'r all do it so i just help everybodi els too out at the same time so it not
1111	t: it sound like a good idea the thing is though we don't even i don't well i don't have cabl realli in my room so i don't watch there ain't noth to watch on tv so i don't watch it the onli time i the onli time i ever do that is like if i'm sleep and just need someth on that that the onli time i ever do other than that the onli thing i do in my room is just sit in my room and listen to music and that it and that that the onli thing i do
1112	t: i don't watch it
1113	t: yeah it would help me
1114	t: well when it come to food wise like like i said everybodi you know we'r all eat healthi we all you know eat what good or whatev we'r all do it becaus my stepfath he a diabet so he also got a work on that too for himself you know everybodi tri to stay healthi too so kind of like so it help me but you know at the same time they'r help everybodi els so it not i don't go out i don't sneak no candi or junk food or noth like that i don't i don't do that you know i probabl have like one i probabl have one a day i probabl eat someth you know that probabl you know a littl fatten but that onli that one day not in a row or noth that onli one day but other than that if it not healthi or good for my bodi i realli don't eat it at all
1115	t: like if i went outsid right now and i was hungri i would probabl come in the hous probabl make me like a bowl of cereal or eat a hot dog drink some water and go back outsid or either just eat an orang or appl and just go back outsid
1116	t: yeah it would
1117	t: it would be
1118	t: yeah i guess it would help
1119	t: probabl just talk about it
1120	t: my plan is to i don't want to necessarili i don't want to just lose all this but i do want it to be at a point where it can be like not death defi not a death defi level but so i guess that my plan i want to do this becaus it so mani peopl that i'v lost in my famili becaus of this and so i realli want to live a long life my famili want me to the thing that might get in my way realli the point i'm at the point where there not realli someth that could get in my way back then there probabl was you know caus i was young but like i'm realli at the point where i'm realli commit to this so i don't realli necessarili think that there will be someth get in my way if i see someth if i see some if i see someth then it'll get 0:17:07 i'm not go to eat it i'm not go to touch it or noth like that i'm just go to
1121	t: i'm stick to this
1122	t: the thing to reach my goal i guess i guess i got to work on my cardio caus it not the food that i eat i do know that i guess that the onli thing the cardio realli i do do it in gym but that onli onli like an hour in gym
1123	t: i i do be walk a lot i do walk a lot but my but my whole year i walk i can walk ani i can walk around the road and not be tire becaus i'm just so use to it the doctor said you can walk as much as you want but if you you have to sweat to kind of work it out if you don't do that then the walk is pointless so i guess i'm go to have to do that like ride bike like ride a bike and stuff i can i can ride a bike anywher i want that that'd be nice but it go to take me a minut for me to start work out 0:18:29 a coupl hour
1124	t: yeah i may be big i may be big i'm not just total lazi i just big i do work out and everyth but my when he explain workout to me i was talk about benchpress 0:18:51 and whatev that kind of what i would do i did anyway and he said that not good becaus you know muscl weigh more than fat so that so they tri to cut that out but i'm that just what i like to do to reliev stuff off my mind it like one of the thing i do
1125	t: i'll say my stepfath yeah he support me a lot with this
1126	t: he he cook and so what he'll do is like like he won't cook noth just for me that healthi and then he'll eat someth he will liter cook someth for everyon that healthi he'll be on me about you know get fruit eat fruit what'd you eat today that type of stuff like that so he help me a lot he encourag me to do this becaus becaus he becaus he actual found out that the kid die at the age of 15 overweight and it shook him up he didn't want the same thing to happen to me so it like kind of realli encourag him to go for long and basic encourag me to stick with this and make sure noth get in my way with this so
1127	t: no i don't eat becaus i'm bore i just eat like if i get hungri then i eat but i'm like if i was at home right now and i was bore i wouldn't just go in the hous like hungri and just eat someth
1128	t: i'd say eight
1129	t: yeah eight caus i realli i just know i just had a doctor appoint i didn't know i was go to be do all this
1130	t: becaus i'm readi everi day and i guess i'm be i guess you know peopl is help me out with this but i guess you know i just need that littl extra shove or whatev kind of becaus they help me but they don't realli know like they know a lot about it but i guess i just need like peopl that liter go to school for this and stuff to help me with this becaus i'm i'm total confus by the whole subject of whi i'm still gain weight
