Electronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly being used to document and store large amounts of clinical information [1]. They replaced traditional paper-based systems in many healthcare organizations and became a vast data sources which can facilitate clinical research and studies to ultimately improve healthcare quality [2–4]. Much of the available clinical data are in narrative form as a result of transcription of dictations, direct entry by providers, or use of speech recognition applications. Comparing to structured data, free text is a more conventional way in the health care environment to express concepts and events. However, free text is very challenging for searching, summarization, decision-support, or statistical analysis. To reduce medical errors, improve health care quality, and enable secondary use of EHRs, information extraction (IE), which structures and encodes clinical information stored in free text, is necessary. However, traditional natural language processing (NLP) tools are not designed for the fragmented free text found in narrative clinical records; therefore, they do not perform well on this type of data. Several different techniques can be used to extract information, from simple pattern matching to complete processing methods based on symbolic information and rules or based on statistical methods and machine learning. Many prior natural language processing (NLP) studies in the clinical domain have used regular expressions in designing their NLP solutions.1–12 These regular expressions are typically created by software developers working with domain experts.
