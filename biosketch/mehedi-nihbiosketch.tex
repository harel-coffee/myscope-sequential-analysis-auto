\section{A. Personal Statement}

\begin{statement}
I have the expertise and motivation necessary to successfully carry out the proposed research project. I have a background in computer science, with specific expertise in health informatics, machine learning, and textual
data analytics. My research includes automatic annotation of clinical text, information extraction from electronic health records for improving the study of cancer risk and outcomes. As a graduate research assistant at several university and NIH-funded grants, I successfully collaborated with other researchers and produced the following publications.

\section{C. Contribution to Science}

\begin{enumerate}

Manual encoding has been used to annotate clinical text of motivational interview transcripts for many years, which is time consuming and resource intensive. However, my research has shown that state-of-the-art machine learning methods can be used as a cheap alternative for the annotation that can facilitate researchers to establish a causal relationship between different communication strategies and desired behavioral outcomes without having to repeatedly wade through pages of interview transcripts.
