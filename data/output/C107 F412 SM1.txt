(004:34),	[SO],	CHW:	Oh.  That'll do it. [laughs]
(004:36),	[HUPO],	CG:	Yeah  and I was like ooh  that's a tough {0:04:36}  Jesus.  So.
(004:42),	[SS],	CHW:	Okay.  So I'm just going through some things with her about how she can still  you know  keep on track with her calorie goals with the holidays.
(004:53),	[LUP+],	CG:	Okay.
(004:55),	[CQO],	CHW:	So the party is going to be here  right?
(004:57),	[HUPW],	CG:	I think so.
(004:58),	[ADV+],	CHW:	Okay  so one thing you can do is =
(005:05),	[CHT+],	CG:	Grilled chicken  I figured we'd have some grilled chicken.
(005:08),	[HUPW],	PT:	Are we doing barbeque?
(005:10),	[LUP+],	CG:	Yeah.
(005:11),	[ADV+],	CHW:	And you can also reduce the number of things that you're offering to serve so that way there's not as many temptations =
(005:18),	[HUPW],	CG:	Temptations.
(005:20),	[HUPW],	CG:	I think it's going to be small.  It ain't going to be all the =
(005:22),	[HUPW],	PT:	'Cause everybody not coming.
(005:23),	[LUP+],	CG:	Mm-mm.
(005:25),	[SO],	CHW:	Okay.
(005:26),	[HUPW],	CG:	The most we usually have  like I might ask my sister to make a chicken pasta salad or 'cause she don't eat potato salad.  So but they like the baked beans and sometimes my other sister make them with the hamburger meat.  She use ground chuck but she might use turkey 'cause she can't dissolve the ground beef as good as she can the turkey.
(005:52),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	Yeah  a lot of people beef doesn't  just doesn't digest as well.
(005:55),	[HUPW],	CG:	Right.  So she might do that and probably grill some chicken  hamburgers  and hot dogs and sausage.
(006:01),	[CQECHT+],	CHW:	Okay.  So you want to stick within your calorie goal  right  Xxxx?
(006:05),	[CHT+],	PT:	Yeah.
(006:07),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	So everything you can  you know  if you know ahead of time you can look up the calorie amounts of the different foods and I actually have like I said I guess I don't have any more of them.  Let me just double check =
(007:16),	[HUPW],	CG:	Oh yeah  pasta salad.
(007:18),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	Mm-hmm.  And then plan how you're going to eat accordingly.
(007:23),	[LUP+],	PT:	(Yeah)
(007:25),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	Okay.  Here you go.
(007:27),	[HUPW],	CG:	'Cause what'd she allowed 1 800 calories  right?
(007:28),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	For the day.
(007:29),	[LUP+],	PT:	Yeah.
(007:30),	[HUPW],	CG:	For the whole day.
(007:31),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	Right  so but I did this with a teen earlier and she picked out enough stuff.  It was 1 300 calories just for the  you know  the chicken and the hot dogs and the baked beans and some desserts and  you know  a few other things.  So =
(007:47),	[HUPW],	PT:	But I'll be having anyway?
(007:50),	[GINFO-],	CHW:	But  you know  if you measure it and those things are on there  those calorie amounts will really help you.  Okay?
(007:59),	[HUPW],	CG:	But regardless you still do your breakfast and then you got to pick out what you're going to have calories all day  300 for your breakfast.  Then what she want you to have  snack?
(008:11),	[GINFO-],	CHW:	Or not because  you know  especially if it's going to be a really big meal later in the day  a small breakfast and a small lunch and that way =
(008:25),	[HUPW],	PT:	No  the snack was supposed to go after the dinner  wasn't it?
(008:27),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	Well  some people  it depends  you know  because your snacks =
(008:31),	[HUPW],	CG:	They don't even have no snack food on here.
(008:32),	[EA],	CHW:	It really don't matter.  You can split it up and you can have two snacks for that amount of calories or you can have one snack.  It's up to you =
(008:41),	[HUPW],	CG:	Ooh  look at that.   Peach {0:08:41} =
(008:42),	[HUPW],	PT:	Kool-Aid got 60 calories?
(008:43),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	Mm-hmm.
(008:44),	[HUPW],	CG:	You know what's not on here?  But I guess we'll put it under that key lime pie  one slice  because that =
(008:51),	[HUPW],	PT:	Oh  ice box
(008:54),	[HUPW],	CG:	It's got the Cool Whip  the Philadelphia cream cheese  egg  and {0:08:58} in it =
(008:59),	[CQTBN],	CHW:	Oh  so this is something you make up yourself?
(009:03),	[HUPW],	PT:	My gram- I mean my auntie Xxxx.
(009:05),	[SO],	CHW:	Okay.
(009:06),	[HUPW],	CG:	Yeah  and she sometimes  if you want a lemon she'll put a little lemon juice in it =
(009:09),	[HUPW],	PT:	Or strawberry.
(009:10),	[SO],	CHW:	Okay.
(009:11),	[HUPW],	CG:	Right  strawberries she'll put the strawberry =
(009:12),	[SO],	CHW:	Mm-hmm.
(009:13),	[HUPW],	PT:	Strawberry on top.
(009:15),	[HUPW],	CG:	= yeah  with the f- but it's a icebox pie  but it's got sugar in it  too =
(009:25),	[ADV-],	CHW:	And you could look up some of the calories  you know  if you know the ingredients and things like that.  If she gives you the recipe you can look up the calories for a slice.
(009:35),	[HUPW],	CG:	Ooh  peach cobbler is 400.  Four hundred calories and I love me some peach cobbler.
(009:42),	[GINFO-],	CHW:	Everything in moderation  you know  that's one of the things we talked about =
(009:48),	[HUPW],	CG:	Yeah  they only give you a little bit at that soul food restaurant right there on the corner.  They did a  cup =
(009:52),	[GINFO-],	CHW:	Half a cup probably =
(009:54),	[HUPW],	CG:	Yeah  it is  something like that.
(009:56),	[GINFO-],	CHW:	= is a serving because of moderation.
(009:59),	[HUPW],	CG:	[laughs] I'll be like  â€œIf I don't eat nothing all day that's what I'm eating.â€?
(010:04),	[SS],	CHW:	So  well  let's get your weight first before we =

(010:43),	[GINFO-],	CHW:	[laughs] That's true.
(010:44),	[HUPW],	CG:	= You know  you can blame me for some of that other stuff but =
(010:49),	[ADV-],	CHW:	Yeah.  Okay.  I was curious.  Come on  hop on.

(012:39),	[HUPW],	CG:	That is too dark purple for me.
(012:41),	[CHT-],	PT:	I like the orange juice.
(012:42),	[HUPO],	CG:	Other they need to have when they do a communion.
(012:47),	[SO],	CHW:	[laughs] Okay.

(012:54),	[HUPW],	PT:	It's 14.
(012:56),	[HUPW],	CG:	Oh okay  so I can have that.  Well  my thing is on a hamburger.  Oh  even a hamburger is cheaper than the bratwurst  so a hamburger is only 250 calories.
(013:12),	[ROS],	CHW:	Two-fifty calories =
(013:13),	[HUPW],	CG:	Yeah  {0:13:14}.  Now if you get two of them so that's 500 and the macaroni and cheese you get 150 =
(013:22),	[SS],	CHW:	So you know how you guys are counting up the calories?  Today we're going to start self-monitoring =
(013:22),	[GINFO-],	CHW:	MISSING TEXT
(013:34),	[LUP+],	PT:	Okay.
(013:35),	[OQECHT+],	CHW:	Okay  so why do you think it might be important to monitor what you're eating or your physical activity?
(013:46),	[CHT+],	PT:	So you won't get =
(013:59),	[RCHT+S],	CHW:	So you don't get bigger  okay.
(014:01),	[LUP+],	PT:	Yeah.
(014:02),	[HUPW],	CG:	What you looking at me for?
(014:03),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	Okay  yeah  that's one reason so that you don't gain weight  anymore weight  okay.
(014:07),	[CHT+],	PT:	So you can keep your weight down especially if it's a goal.
(014:10),	[AFL],	CHW:	Yeah  that's good. And but there are a few reasons why monitoring your food intake and your physical activity are important =
(014:10),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	MISSING TEXT
(014:20),	[CHT+],	PT:	So you can be healthy.
(014:21),	[RCHT+S],	CHW:	So you can be healthy but the number one reason  it gives you a accurate {0:14:24} record of what you're actually eating or how much physical activity you're really doing  okay.  So for example  people find out that they usually forget about the small things that they eat or drink during the day  you know  like school starts up.  Your friends say  â€œHey  you want some of these cookies?â€? and they give you a few cookies  right?  But you forget about them 'cause if you don't write them down it doesn't mean those calories don't count  it just means that you didn't count them.  So writing things down gives you a real accurate record of what you're putting in your mouth  okay?  And so it can help you with weight loss because it makes you think more about what you're eating.  Okay?  And when people start to see what they're eating through the day sometimes they make better choices.  â€œI gotta write this down.  Do I really want somebody looking at this.â€?
(014:21),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	MISSING TEXT
(015:24),	[LUP+],	PT:	Yeah.
(015:26),	[CQTBN],	CHW:	Okay  and how do you think that applies to physical activity?  [pause] You don't know?
(015:38),	[LUP+],	PT:	Mm-mm.
(015:41),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	Okay.  Well  if you start tracking your physical activity you might see where you could get more activity in places when you were  you know  when you were active and when you were it'll you figure out what caused you to be active and what got in the way of you doing it  being active.  So tracking that is helpful  too  okay?  And people who write things down  everything down  they can see these patterns.  They really aren't clear right now  okay.  What do you think you could learn from writing down your food and your activity?
(015:41),	[OQECHT+],	CHW:	MISSING TEXT
(016:18),	[CHT+],	PT:	To eat better  'cause I don't track what I eat or  well  I don't track what I eat and I don't want to eat {0:16:28} =
(016:28),	[CQECHT+],	CHW:	So you feel that writing the things down will help you eat better? =
(016:32),	[CHT+],	PT:	Yeah  what I actually eat  and then the time I should eat it.
(016:35),	[AFL],	CHW:	Okay  great.
(016:37),	[HUPW],	CG:	And it also helps you to know what the calories are that you're going to {0:16:41} =
(016:42),	[LUP+],	PT:	Yeah.
(016:43),	[AFL],	CHW:	That's true  Mom  that's a good  good one there.  Okay  and you also might see some other things like the times of the day when you're more like to overeat  who you're with when you make healthy or unhealthy choices and how hungry you are  okay?  How do you think that can help you figure out what steps you need to reduce calories?  [pause] You don't know?

(016:43),	[OQECHT+],	CHW:	MISSING TEXT

(017:13),	[HUPW],	PT:	Say that again.
(017:14),	[CQECHT+],	CHW:	How do you think writing down what you eat could help you figure out what steps you need to take to reduce calories?
(017:22),	[LUP+],	PT:	I'm not sure.
(017:23),	[CQTBN],	CHW:	You're not sure?  Okay.  Well  you might learn that you'll get most of your calories from sources that surprise you  okay  like the things that you put on a sandwich maybe  the ketchup  the mustard  you know  those toppings like the cheese and those types of things or what you drink  okay.  You might also learn when you get the most of your activity.  Like you might get it at school or you may get it at home.  So monitoring your food and your activity can help you out in a few different ways.  Does that make sense?
(017:23),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	MISSING TEXT
(017:23),	[CQTBN],	CHW:	MISSING TEXT
(017:58),	[LUP+],	PT:	Yeah.
(017:59),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	Okay.  And then self-monitoring  it also allow you to see the positive changes that you're making while you're making them  okay  because that keeps you motivated a little bit longer.  You think  â€œOh wow  I didn't eat all this junk today.  I went a day without eating candy and potato chips.â€?  So then you'll think about that the next day  you're a little bit more motivated to do without those things  you know  because you'll see that  â€œYeah  I can do without this.â€?  Whereas maybe before you thought  â€œOh  I gotta have me these cookies â€? =
(017:59),	[OQEF],	CHW:	MISSING TEXT

(022:15),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	So if it's okay with you I'd like to go over the things that you learned during the session  some of those tools that you used with Jenny  because those are going to help you with self-monitoring.  So you've got your CalorieKing book =
(022:43),	[ADV+],	CG:	She can pick out  and once you get used to using that book you can pretty much pick out your own meal plan.
(022:48),	[CML+],	PT:	I looked at it for applesauce.
(022:51),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	Okay.  Now because  you know  Jenny taught you how to use the food labels  read the food labels  and it's always better to read the label if there is one  but sometimes things don't have the food label and then when you're at school that food doesn't have a label on it also  like if they serve pizza you wouldn't  know  you know  there's no food label on that slice of pizza  okay.  And then when you eat homemade foods or foods at restaurants a lot of times you don't know how many calories are in those foods  okay.  So the first tool that the CalorieKing book there will be good for those types of situations  okay?  And we're going to go over how to use it.  And then you talked with Jenny about  you know  how eating large portions of foods even healthy foods they can cause people to =
(023:39),	[HUPW],	PT:	Gain weight.
(023:40),	[GINFO+],	CHW:	Right.  Because they'll eat more calories than they need.  And so the portion size guide which is in here  did you get familiar with it?  No  not yet.

(023:52),	[GINFO-],	CHW:	Okay.  That'll help you  okay.  And 'cause you can compare your portion sizes to everyday items like a computer mouse or the deck of cards  okay.  And then the third tool is the list of how many calories you burn for a certain amount of physical activity such as walking  climbing stairs  and other types of exercises or working out.  So now that we've gone over those let's get started learning how to do self-monitoring.  So first though  you have a choice of which  if you'd like to learn first for food or for physical activity because whichever one you don't choose we'll do that next time after we do the review  so which =

Well  it was moderate  okay  I wasn't trying to run a race or anything so it was moderate. And how many calories burned?  So it was 15 minutes now 22 minutes for moderate burns 100 calories so I did 15 so we could say about 75  80 calories.  So I'm going to say 80 calories there  okay?  And then I did some  just some aerobics for about 20 minutes  okay?  Twenty minutes and that was pretty vigorous  so I'm going to circle the V.
