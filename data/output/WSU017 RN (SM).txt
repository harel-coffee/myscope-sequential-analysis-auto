(000:02),	[HUPO],	PT: – in your mouth with this lotion and stuff. I didn't want that one.
(000:06),	[OQO],	HCP1: Well  I have the ChapStick  but I didn't know they – wow. All right. So how are you?
(000:10),	[HUPO],	PT: I'm fine. I'm great.
(000:12),	[OQO],	HCP1: Where have you been? You knew I would ask.
(000:15),	[HUPO],	PT: I've been everywhere. Just really been working a lot from one to the end. The dancing has been happening everywhere. We're finally getting noticed.
(000:25),	[OQO],	HCP1: Congrats. Now where are you working?
(000:28),	[HUPO],	PT: Um  right now I work at [Couple Hall]  and I still work at  um – um  I'm working at – as a home-care giver.
(000:36),	[SD],	HCP1: Okay  nice.
(000:36),	[HUPO],	PT: I do that as well.
(000:38),	[CQO],	HCP1: Okay  who are you – like  for who?
(000:40),	[HUPO],	PT: Um  for my grandma. She – I'm like her – like one of them – I don't know how you say like a home-aid person where they pay you  like you're just her in-home nurse or something.
(000:49),	[OQO],	HCP1: Okay  so what do you do?
(000:51),	[HUPO],	PT: I just help her. Like  I wash her up. She gets in the tub. I feed her  bake her food. I make sure I'm all clean  and I take her to her appointments and things like that.
(000:59),	[CON],	HCP1: Okay  got it. So  last time you were here we – you have not seen me since July.
(001:05),	[HUPHIV],	PT: July? No  I came here before [sic] July. It was – the last time I came was July?
(001:12),	[CON],	HCP1: Yeah  and you were positive for gonorrhea and we treated you on that July visit.
(001:17),	[HUPHIV],	PT: Oh yes  that's what that was. I did not know that was July. That was a very long time. I'm sorry  I'm really messing up these – this time. I just be so busy. I really am sorry for that.
(001:28),	[CON],	HCP1: So this is it. It's your health  right? It's your health. You've got to prioritize your health.
(001:34),	[CHT+],	PT: Yes.
(001:34),	[WARN],	HCP1: Right? Because if you get sick  then you can't dance and you can't work. So then these things that are keeping you busy are going to be gone  right?
(001:46),	[LUP+],	PT: Yes.
(001:49),	[GINFO+],	HCP1: So  uh  the last time you were here you were undetectable  which is good  so congratulations  and your –
(001:56),	[HUPHIV],	PT: What does that mean?
(001:56),	[GINFO+],	HCP1: Your viral load was – it – your viral load was less than 20.
(002:01),	[LUP+],	PT: Wow.
(002:04),	[HUPHIV],	PT: I did not know that. [Laughs]
(002:05),	[GINFO-],	HCP1: Yeah. Last time you were undetectable. So what that means to me is that you're taking your meds.
(002:09),	[CML+],	PT: Mm-hmm. See  that's the issue. That's why I'm here  because I stopped – like  I stopped receiving them  and like – and I've been trying to get in contact. I told – I talked to Irv  but when I tried to contact you guys – I don't know why I did that. I contacted you while it was almost close to the holiday  and I left voice messages at your office  but they said you have plenty of offices  so – so it was something. I don't know what was wrong  but I was trying to get in contact with y'all before Christmas – like the week before Christmas  and they said y'all was on vacation.
(002:34),	[CQTBN],	HCP1: Who did you talk to?
(002:36),	[HUPHIV],	PT: Um  I talked to Irving. Before I talked to him  it was some other lady. They said that y'all were on vacation and y'all weren't going to be back until the New Year's  so then I'd have to call again after that.
(002:45),	[CQECML-],	HCP1: Did you say that you didn't have meds?
(002:46),	[CML+],	PT: Yeah  I told them  but then that's when I talked to Irv in the New Year. Like  I talked to him I think on the 5th  and he said that  um  he will call the MedCard people and see what was going on – why they didn't – why they stopped sending me – because he said I was supposed to receive six bags  and I only received four – and I told him  yeah  it was only for those last four. I guess  like  I thought y'all would be back for the last four months of the year  because I didn't get six. I got four  and he said I was supposed to get six.
(003:08),	[GINFO+],	HCP1: We do six refills.
(003:10),	[HUPHIV],	PT: Yeah  I didn't get six of them. I only got four.
(003:12),	[SD],	HCP1: Okay.
(003:14),	[HUPHIV],	PT: That's what I – that's why I didn't know what was going on  because that normally doesn't happen. When y'all did it the last time  y'all gave me six  and then this time it was only four.
(003:22),	[CQECML+],	HCP1: So when was the last time you took your meds?
(003:24),	[CML-],	PT: Uh  I would say it would almost be a month. Like  it would be like three – maybe three weeks  yeah.
(003:30),	[CQECML+],	HCP1: Um  what are you taking?
(003:33),	[CML+],	PT: Um  the three – the Truvada  [00:03:36.3]. I don't know how to say them all. They're really weird.
(003:37),	[CQECML+],	HCP1: Truvada  [00:03:38.7]?
(003:38),	[HUPHIV],	PT: Yes. They're some really weird names.
(003:41),	[CQECML-],	HCP1: Okay  so outside of when you have been off the past month  any other missed doses?
(003:46),	[CML+],	PT: Um  no. I normally just take my medicine every day like you guys tell me too. It's just...
(003:53),	[GINFO],	HCP1: So  I'm going to give you my number too  because you – if you call me and say  hey  I don't have any meds  we're going to get it figured out  because the problem with you being off meds like this is it puts you at risk for what?
(003:53),	[WARN],	HCP1:	MISSING TEXT
(004:07),	[HUPHIV],	PT: For other things  right?
(004:09),	[CON],	HCP1: What? What are other things?
(004:13),	[CHT+],	PT: Would it  like – well  I don't know if after I stop taking my meds – I started to itch a lot again. I know that.
(004:18),	[WARN],	HCP1: Possibly that  but what else? What happens when you're not on your HIV meds and then you go back on?
(004:22),	[HUPHIV],	PT: My HIV viral load will go back up high  right?
(004:23),	[WARN],	HCP1: Mm-hmm  and what else?
(004:27),	[HUPHIV],	PT: Can't it get worse?
(004:29),	[WARN],	HCP1: But how? What do I mean?
(004:32),	[HUPHIV],	PT: I don't know.
(004:33),	[WARN],	HCP1: [00:04:33.3]  where the med doesn't work. Your body can become resistant to the medication  where it doesn't work.
(004:40),	[LUP+],	PT: Okay.
(004:43),	[ADV-],	HCP1: So  I mean  we're going to – we'll restart you back on it today. I want you to come back in two weeks. Um  well  I'll call – we'll call and figure out what was wrong – why you didn't get the meds. Did you call MedCard yourself?
(004:43),	[GINFO-],	HCP1:	MISSING TEXT
(004:43),	[CQECML+],	HCP1:	MISSING TEXT
(004:55),	[CHT-],	PT: Um  I don't have a MedCard. I don't know.
(004:57),	[CQTBN],	HCP1: Is it on the bottle?
(004:59),	[HUPHIV],	PT: I don't know.
(004:59),	[GINFO-],	HCP1: It's on the bottle. Do you have your meds with you?
(005:01),	[HUPHIV],	PT: No  I don't have them with me. I haven't had any in a long time.
(005:05),	[GINFO-],	HCP1: Just heads up  a lot of times on the bottle it'll say what the pharmacy is and what the numbers are. Um  so next time call. You call MedCard and be like  what's going on? Why don't I have my meds? Because sometimes  too  if an address changes or a number changes  they can't get a hold with you. I think every month they have to verify your – kind of where you're at before they resend them out.
(005:27),	[HUPO],	PT: Yes  I'm at – I've been at the same address. It's the same one.
(005:30),	[GINFO+],	HCP1: Okay  then I don't know. Um  but I'm going to give you my number.
(005:32),	[HUPO],	PT: Yeah  I'm ready.
(005:33),	[GINFO+],	HCP1: Uh  313-745-4454.
(005:41),	[LUP+],	PT: Okay.
(005:41),	[GINFO+],	HCP1: All right  so next time just give me a call  and I – we can get it figured out  okay? All right  so  any – in general  just any health concerns? Anything you want to discuss?
(005:41),	[CQO],	HCP1:	MISSING TEXT
(005:54),	[CML+],	PT: Um  I was just – I – just coming from my regular appointment  and then – um  to tell you guys that I haven't been on the medicine in like three weeks – and then  like  after the medicine  it's just me not taking it. My body be so itchy now.
(006:08),	[CQTBN],	HCP1: Okay  where are you itchy?
(006:09),	[HUPHIV],	PT: Like  I itch  like  normally  like  on my arms or on my legs  and then  like  um – oh yes  like  when I stopped taking the medicine  it was like – I don't know if it was like a mark or something  but it's like a mark that's disappearing on the top of my head penis again – but it's not like what it was the first time. It's just like a mark. It looks like it's in my skin  but it's not. I don't know. It do look different from what – I've never seen it before.
(006:37),	[CQTBN],	HCP1: How long has that been there?
(006:37),	[HUPHIV],	PT: Um  like – I would say like two weeks.
(006:40),	[CQTBN],	HCP1: Okay. Does it itch or anything?
(006:41),	[HUPO],	PT: No  it doesn't itch. Like  I just be – I don't know. It just my – like  all this inner be itching  and then my sidearms – like  that's what really be itching now  and it's weird. Like  just this and my arms.
(006:54),	[CQO],	HCP1: So  I have a question. Does it happen more during certain times of the year  or has this never happened before?
(006:58),	[HUPO],	PT: Like  it only happens around this year. Like  I – it probably might just be my eczema. I don't know  because it normally happens around the wintertime with this dusty air.
(007:06),	[SD],	HCP1: It could be the dry skin  and it shifts.
(007:08),	[LUP+],	PT: Yeah.
(007:08),	[CQO],	HCP1: Do you use  like  special lotion?
(007:10),	[HUPO],	PT: Yeah  I use  like  um  cocoa butter. I use cocoa butter lotion  and I use Dove lotion  because that's – well  my doctor said  before I started coming to you guys – that's what I was recommended to use  because all the other soaps and stuff would make my skin peel and everything  and it was really nasty.
(007:25),	[CQO],	HCP1: Okay. No  I was going to say keep doing that [00:07:26.6] seal it in some Vaseline  so just kind of put that all over. We already talked about meds. You're living with your mom  right?
(007:26),	[HUPO],	PT: Yes.
(007:36),	[SD],	HCP1: Um  and then you're working at [Cogo] Hall  and you're also working at the Home and Health Aid  and you're dancing. Oh  you're 18.
(007:54),	[HUPO],	PT: No  I'm 19. I'm going to be 20 this year.
(007:57),	[CQO],	HCP1: Are you dancing through school?
(007:59),	[HUPO],	PT: No  it's the regular program  like – they're just an international traveling dance team – just regular like that.
(008:06),	[CQO],	HCP1: Got it. Do you like it?
(008:07),	[HUPO],	PT: It's really fun. Like  it's really fun. Now we even got to the point where we're really going to be on the next season of "Bring It" with Diana. It's really coming together  and we're fixing to get ready to have our own studio in another couple of months.
(008:19),	[CQO],	HCP1: Okay. Now  what type of dance is it?
(008:20),	[HUPO],	PT: It's like all – it's like a mixture of modern and jazz  hip hop. And then they also do the [Jay said] – like  have you ever seen what the college girls do?
(008:28),	[CQO],	HCP1: Yeah?
(008:28),	[HUPO],	PT: That one  yeah.
(008:29),	[SD],	HCP1: Well  I looked it up on YouTube.
(008:32),	[HUPO],	PT: Yes  that's like a really new style now that's really trending  and we do that one as well. Like  we just won a competition for that for like $3 500. Came in first place  and we got to be on Diana's show. That's what we're doing now.
(008:43),	[SD],	HCP1: Congratulations.
(008:44),	[LUP+],	PT: Thank you.
(008:47),	[CQTBN],	HCP1: Just remind me  do you drink alcohol?
(008:49),	[HUPHIV],	PT: Um  the last time I – actually yes  I went out to the club  like  I think a week ago  and I had one cup. Yes  I did.
(008:56),	[CQTBN],	HCP1: At the club?
(008:56),	[HUPHIV],	PT: Yeah.
(008:57),	[CQO],	HCP1: How? You're 19.
(008:59),	[HUPO],	PT: Yeah. Uh  the clubs in Detroit are 18 and older.
(009:02),	[SD],	HCP1: Yeah  but you still can't drink.
(009:04),	[HUPO],	PT: Yeah  you can't drink  but I guess – you know how when you in a club  people buy liquor for you and stuff like that. Like me  personally  every time I'm in the club  people always want to come and see me  ask me  do they want to buy me this? Do they want to buy me that? So  it just be like that.
(009:16),	[CQTBN],	HCP1: Okay. Um  so on average about how often do you drink?
(009:19),	[CML+],	PT: I wouldn't say I don't drink often. I only drink when I go out  and I really go out.
(009:23),	[CQECML+],	HCP1: Like once a month?
(009:24),	[CML+],	PT: I wouldn't say that. I would probably say  like – you could probably say like once every three to four months. I really don't go out like that. Like  I really hate the clubs. The Detroit clubs? They are really just too much for me. The only reason I went out was because it was my friend's birthday  and he really wanted me to come. So I did.
(009:38),	[OQO],	HCP1: What do you mean by too much? I've not been.
(009:39),	[HUPO],	PT: Like  they just – the gay world in Detroit – it's really too much. Like  they just be – all they want to do is fight and argue over who's sleeping with somebody's man and all of this. It just be too much drama. Like  I feel like it's not safe to go to the clubs no more because you're wasting your money. You're paying $15 to get in.
(009:55),	[CQO],	HCP1: $15?
(009:56),	[HUPO],	PT: Yes. Like  you've got to pay that much. Then you get put out because somebody in the club fighting  and y’all want to shut the whole club down. Like  I just be feeling like I be wasting my money. There's no point in me going if I'm going to keep getting put out because of ignorant people.
(010:10),	[CQO],	HCP1: Right. All right  any tobacco use? Any cigarettes?
(010:13),	[HUPO],	PT: Um  I smoked a jazz whatsit from here and there.
(010:18),	[CQO],	HCP1: Wait  a cigarette?
(010:18),	[HUPO],	PT: No  a jazz – it's call a jazz whatsit.
(010:20),	[OQO],	HCP1: What's that?
(010:21),	[HUPO],	PT: It's – I don't know. It's like a black  but it's just a name for it  I guess.
(010:24),	[CQO],	HCP1: Like a little cigar?
(010:25),	[HUPO],	PT: Yeah.
(010:26),	[CQO],	HCP1: About how often are you smoking?
(010:27),	[HUPO],	PT: Well  I only do that when I go to the club. Like  that's the same thing as the drinking. I only do that to keep the liquor down.
(010:33),	[SD],	HCP1: Okay  I wouldn't... You're dancing.
(010:37),	[HUPO],	PT: Yes. [Laughs]
(010:37),	[CQTBN],	HCP1: Okay? Any drug use? Marijuana? Cocaine?
(010:39),	[CML+],	PT: No.
(010:39),	[CQO],	HCP1: Okay. And then since you were last here  any sexual activity?
(010:42),	[HUPO],	PT: No.
(010:43),	[CQO],	HCP1: No? Nothing?
(010:43),	[HUPO],	PT: Mm-mm.
(010:44),	[CQO],	HCP1: No sexual –
(010:46),	[HUPO],	PT: I haven't had time. I've been so busy  it's just everything – the dancing  the working. I don't even have time to have... My mama keeps saying – she like  "I just feel like you just trying to put your life on hold now and you act like you don't want to have a boyfriend." I'm like  "It's not that. I just feel like I just don't want to do it no more. I'm just over it. Like  I just really want to live my life. I'm young. When I get older – I feel it's best for me to just wait until I get older  so if I am still in this condition  we can actually have a serious talk about what I have and where we're going to from there. And if you still want to continue to talk to me..." It's like  right now  me being young  I'm afraid to have that talk with someone. Like  I really don't want that to be out  so it's just – that's me. It's just do what I'm doing now. Just dance  have fun. I have fun doing that. My life is not boring  so... I mean  I live. I have a really good life. It's just – I'm just not ready for nobody to be a part of me right now.
(011:33),	[SD],	HCP1: Honestly  if you're happy then that's good. I mean  and when the right time comes and the right person that you actually want to have part of your life come  then it's good.
(011:43),	[HUPO],	PT: Yes  that's how I feel  because I don't...
(011:45),	[SD],	HCP1: Do you feel like you get pressured from other people to – I mean  outside of your mom?
(011:49),	[HUPO],	PT: Um  my grandma. She be – when I be up there helping her out with things  she's always asking me  "So when are you going to have you someone?" I'm like  "Granny  please. I don't – why do you keep asking me that?" I'm like  "Grandma  you know my condition as well. I don't want to have that conversation with nobody right now. I'm too young. I'm scared." And she was like  "Oh  I understand" – and yadda yadda yadda.
(012:10),	[SUP],	HCP1: Well if you do  like  meet somebody and you want help getting that conversation  we are here.
(012:14),	[LUP+],	PT: Okay.
(012:15),	[CQO],	HCP1: Now  open up – under your tongue. Do you have pictures – I mean  do you have any videos of you dancing?
(012:30),	[HUPO],	PT: Um  yeah  we have a lot of videos on YouTube  actually.
(012:51),	[CQO],	HCP1: I'm going to have you take a deep breath. Can you lay back for me? Did you eat breakfast today?
(013:41),	[HUPO],	PT: Um  no I didn't.
(013:45),	[CQO],	HCP1: No breakfast and no lunch?
(013:46),	[CHT+],	PT: No. I woke up  and as soon as I woke up  I was like  I'm going to be late. I forgot – because I forgot what time I set my appointment. I thought I set it to 2:00  but when I got here  they said it wasn't until 3:00 – but I still wanted to make sure I was here on time.
(013:59),	[AFL],	HCP1: Well  thank you for that. All right  and since we're going to – I'm going to have – I'm going to get your number. I mean  I'm going to get your number because I want to make sure that we have the right number in case MedCard asks me for a new number – anything crazy like that. What is your phone number?
(014:15),	[HUPO],	PT: [XXXX]
(014:23),	[GINFO-],	HCP1: Okay. So XXXX  what I'm going to ask is if you could give me a little bit of urine – just a touch. So  plan... We're going to research back on your medication. I want you back in two weeks.
(014:23),	[ADV-],	HCP1:	MISSING TEXT
(014:38),	[LUP+],	PT: Okay.
(014:40),	[GINFO-],	HCP1: Two weeks.
(014:42),	[HUPHIV],	PT: Okay. So  um – so what does that mean today on  like – now they're starting me back on the medication today?
(014:48),	[GINFO-],	HCP1: Yeah  I'm going to call – we're going to call MedCard  figure out why you didn't get your meds – and get that figured out. I want you to start – start back on them. Um  I want to see you in two weeks  because we want to make sure that you're not resistant  and I want to make sure that your viral load is going down. If it's not going down  then it could mean that you're resistant and we have to start another medication  which obviously I hope that's not the case. Um  is there anything – is there anything else?
(015:18),	[HUPO],	PT: No  that was basically it.
(015:19),	[CQECHT+],	HCP1: Do you need condoms? Anything like that?
(015:21),	[CHT+],	PT: Um  no. I mean  that would be helpful if you guys have some.
(015:25),	[SD],	HCP1: Well  absolutely.
(015:26),	[HUPHIV],	PT: What condoms do you guys have  though? Because there's a certain kinds that I'm only allowed to use.
(015:30),	[GINFO+],	HCP1: I don't know  but I will [00:15:31.2]. And they know all the different types of condoms. Um  and so what I'm going to ask from you is that you put a little bit of urine  and after you go to the – after go do the sample  if you could just put it in this bag  and all this will go down with you to the fourth floor when you're done.
(015:50),	[HUPHIV],	PT: The lab? [00:15:51.0]
(015:52),	[GINFO],	HCP1: Yep  all of it's going to go.
(015:55),	[HUPHIV],	PT: Okay  because I never did that part before.
(015:57),	[ADV-],	HCP1: You know  why don't we do three weeks?
(015:58),	[HUPHIV],	PT: Three weeks?
(015:58),	[ADV-],	HCP1: Three weeks  not a month. I want you back in three weeks.
(016:02),	[HUPHIV],	PT: So like  February when? Like the 8th of February? Is that what that is?
(016:07),	[GINFO-],	HCP1: I think middle of February – the middle of February. That way I can see how you're doing on the meds after a month  okay?
(016:12),	[LUP+],	PT: Okay.
(016:15),	[CQO],	HCP1: I think that's it. Is there anything else that you need from me? Condoms. Three weeks. I'll send Irving in quickly  and we'll call MedCard and make sure that everything's okay. For future – look on your bottle. It'll say what your pharmacy is and what the number is. Call them and be like  where is my med?
(016:30),	[CML+],	PT: Yes  I will most definitely do that.
(016:34),	[CQTBN],	HCP1: But all right. Here. Are you able to go right now?
(016:36),	[CHT+],	PT: Yes  I can do it.
(016:40),	[SS],	HCP1: All right. Do this  and then it'll go right in here  and I will see you  okay?
(016:43),	[LUP+],	PT: Okay.
