(000:00)CHW:	This is Family 412 and today is August the 29th.  So well, first I’m going to check up with you on your physical activity. So how’s that been going?

(000:13)CG:	Good.

(000:14)CHW:	Good, so =

(000:15)PT:	I looked on YouTube, they had—I did some Zumbas and some—what’s that other one?

(000:28)CHW:	Hip-Hop?  There’s Zumba, there’s Hip-Hop, was it dance or was it some-?

(000:32)PT:	Yeah, it was another one, the one that you said.  I think it was…it was, I did another one.  I forgot what it was called but it was a 3-mile walk like on =

(000:47)CHW:	Okay, on YouTube?  Okay.

(000:49)PT:	Yeah, she was walking, kicking her legs and going side-to-side.  She did a walk back and forth with the arms, too.  It was a workout, that’s for sure.

(001:06)CHW:	Wow, you’ve really gotten into it now.  Yeah, so you’re sort of motivated to lose weight.  Now you know how to exercise.  

(001:13)PT:	Mm-hmm.

(001:13)CHW:	So how often have you been doing it?

(001:16)PT:	I do it every day.

(001:17)CHW:	Okay.  For the hour like we talked about before?

(001:21)PT:	Mm-hmm.

(001:22)CHW:	Okay, so you’re finding different things to do, too.

(001:24)PT:	Yeah.

(001:26)CHW:	Okay, that’s good ‘cause that Zumba gives you a workout =

(001:28)PT:	Yeah, it’s not as easy as it looks either.

(001:31)CHW:	No, it’s not. We had, my supervisor, her daughter is a Zumba instructor.  She came in and she taught it to us so, yes, you work up a sweat =

(001:41)PT:	It’s a lot.

(001:42)CHW:	Yeah, doing Zumba, =

(001:43)PT:	Mm-hmm.

(001:45)CHW:	= so I’m glad.  Okay, so you got plans for the holidays?

(001:49)PT:	I don't know what we’re doing.  I don’t know.

(001:53)CHW:	You don’t know what you’re doing so hope I didn’t give out the last one.  I know we talked about it a little bit.  I must have gave out the last one.  I had made copies of something.  Well, so the holiday is this weekend and you guys barbeque or?

(002:27)PT:	I’m not sure because I think we’re having it here, I think.

(002:31)CHW:	Okay, so can I offer you a few tips or some things just to help keep you, you know.  Oh, here we go.  I’ve got this, okay, and this has got some, oh, and I got the spinach lasagna rolls, too.  Right, they were right next to each other.  There, okay, there’s that.  And this just talks about some ways that you can, you know, like it says, have your cake and eat it, too.  Just enjoy the holiday and enjoy the foods, okay, and just stick with your weight loss goals.  You don’t want to skip meals before, you know, like the big meal like if you guys have like barbeque and that’s for dinner, okay =

(003:28)PT:	You start small and then that be my big thing =

(003:30)CHW:	Yeah, right, that’s a good idea.  And that is one thing, okay.  And then, you know, stick to your schedule like your meal and your snack schedule, stick to that.  And before you fill up your plate, look at all the food.  Are you doing the cooking or is somebody else doing it?

(003:47)PT:	Somebody else.

(003:48)CHW:	Okay, so look at everything and then pick out your favorite things, and you know, leave the things that you don’t really like or things that you can have anytime and just fill up your plate one time and be careful.

(004:04)PT:	With how much I eat I’ll put it on the plate?

(004:06)CHW:	Yeah, and with the beverages, you know?

(004:09)PT:	Oh, yeah.

(004:10)CHW:	Because remember we talked about how they…

(004:13)PT:	The sugar?

(004:15)CG:	Okay, y’all can come in now.  I’m sorry.

(004:15)CHW:	Okay, no problem.

(004:17)PT:	About the sugars and stuff?

(004:18)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(004:20)CG:	{0:04:17} I’m trying to get everything {0:04:18}.

(004:22)CHW:	No problem.  I’m sorry I’m late.  I was running late anyway so =

(004:25)CG:	Yeah, when you called I couldn’t answer the phone ‘cause he had, well, the girl was taking my blood and it was killing me.

(004:32)CHW:	Killing you. [laughs] Okay.

(004:32)CG:	She only been doing it for a month.

(004:34)CHW:	Oh.  That’ll do it. [laughs] 

(004:36)CG:	Yeah, and I was like ooh, that’s a tough {0:04:36}, Jesus.  So.

(004:42)CHW:	Okay.  So I’m just going through some things with her about how she can still, you know, keep on track with her calorie goals with the holidays.  

(004:53)CG:	Okay.

(004:55)CHW:	So the party is going to be here, right?

(004:57)CG:	I think so.

(004:58)CHW:	Okay, so one thing you can do is =

(005:05)CG:	Grilled chicken, I figured we’d have some grilled chicken.

(005:08)PT:	Are we doing barbeque?

(005:10)CG:	Yeah.

(005:11)CHW:	And you can also reduce the number of things that you’re offering to serve so that way there’s not as many temptations =

(005:18)CG:	Temptations.

(005:19)CHW:	= so you’ll have grilled chicken and =

(005:20)CG:	I think it’s going to be small.  It ain’t going to be all the =

(005:22)PT:	‘Cause everybody not coming.

(005:23)CG:	Mm-mm.

(005:25)CHW:	Okay.

(005:26)CG:	The most we usually have, like I might ask my sister to make a chicken pasta salad or ‘cause she don’t eat potato salad.  So but they like the baked beans and sometimes my other sister make them with the hamburger meat.  She use ground chuck but she might use turkey ‘cause she can’t dissolve the ground beef as good as she can the turkey.

(005:52)CHW:	Yeah, a lot of people beef doesn’t, just doesn’t digest as well.

(005:55)CG:	Right.  So she might do that and probably grill some chicken, hamburgers, and hot dogs and sausage.

(006:01)CHW:	Okay.  So you want to stick within your calorie goal, right, Xxxx?

(006:05)PT:	Yeah.

(006:07)CHW:	So everything you can, you know, if you know ahead of time you can look up the calorie amounts of the different foods and I actually have like I said I guess I don’t have any more of them.  Let me just double check =

(006:21)CG:	{0:06:22}

(006:23)CHW:	Okay, here, this is for you and then get in, so you got cousins coming over.  You can dance with them and have a little fun with.  Here you go.  Here we go.  This has got the calorie amounts.  This is the same thing.  You hand that to your mom?  But this has got the calorie amounts and serving size for most of your favorite foods people make when they’re,  you know =

(006:52)CG:	Oh, okay.

(006:54)CHW:	= grilling, on the back pages there, you’ve got like baked beans, okay.  They’ve got 140 calories, but so I’m not sure about the ones with the meat though because that meat adds calories.  And these are half-cup servings so actually you can use this to help you figure out how many calories are in the foods. =

(007:16)CG:	Oh yeah, pasta salad.

(007:18)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  And then plan how you’re going to eat accordingly.

(007:23)PT:	(Yeah)

(007:25)CHW:	Okay.  Here you go.

(007:27)CG:	‘Cause what’d she allowed 1,800 calories, right?

(007:28)CHW:	For the day.

(007:29)PT:	Yeah.

(007:30)CG:	For the whole day.

(007:31)CHW:	Right, so but I did this with a teen earlier and she picked out enough stuff.  It was 1,300 calories just for the, you know, the chicken and the hot dogs and the baked beans and some desserts and, you know, a few other things.  So =

(007:47)PT:	But I’ll be having anyway?

(007:50)CHW:	But, you know, if you measure it and those things are on there, those calorie amounts will really help you.  Okay?

(007:59)CG:	But regardless you still do your breakfast and then you got to pick out what you’re going to have calories all day, 300 for your breakfast.  Then what she want you to have, snack?

(008:11)CHW:	Or not because, you know, especially if it’s going to be a really big meal later in the day, a small breakfast and a small lunch and that way =

(008:25)PT:	No, the snack was supposed to go after the dinner, wasn’t it?

(008:27)CHW:	Well, some people, it depends, you know, because your snacks =

(008:31)CG:	They don’t even have no snack food on here.

(008:32)CHW:	It really don’t matter.  You can split it up and you can have two snacks for that amount of calories or you can have one snack.  It’s up to you =

(008:41)CG:	Ooh, look at that.   Peach {0:08:41} = 

(008:42)PT:	Kool-Aid got 60 calories?

(008:43)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  

(008:44)CG:	You know what’s not on here?  But I guess we’ll put it under that key lime pie, one slice, because that =

(008:51)PT:	Oh, ice box 

(008:52)CG:	= ice box pie? 

(008:53)PT:	[laughs]

(008:54)CG:	It’s got the Cool Whip, the Philadelphia cream cheese, egg, and {0:08:58} in it =

(008:59)CHW:	Oh, so this is something you make up yourself?

(009:02)CG:	= graham cracker crust =

(009:03)PT:	My gram- I mean my auntie Xxxx.

(009:05)CHW:	Okay.

(009:06)CG:	Yeah, and she sometimes, if you want a lemon she’ll put a little lemon juice in it =

(009:09)PT:	Or strawberry.

(009:10)CHW:	Okay.

(009:11)CG:	Right, strawberries she’ll put the strawberry =

(009:12)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  

(009:13)PT:	Strawberry on top.

(009:15)CG:	= yeah, with the f- but it’s a icebox pie, but it’s got sugar in it, too =

(009:17)CHW:	Okay, yeah.

(009:18)CG:	= so I’ll put it under the lemon Key lime pie because it’s a pie, but it’s just a refrigerated one.  

(009:25)CHW:	And you could look up some of the calories, you know, if you know the ingredients and things like that.  If she gives you the recipe you can look up the calories for a slice.

(009:35)CG:	Ooh, peach cobbler is 400.  Four hundred calories and I love me some peach cobbler.

(009:42)CHW:	Everything in moderation, you know, that’s one of the things we talked about =

(009:48)CG:	Yeah, they only give you a little bit at that soul food restaurant right there on the corner.  They did a  cup =

(009:52)CHW:	Half a cup probably =

(009:54)CG:	Yeah, it is, something like that.

(009:56)CHW:	= is a serving because of moderation.  

(009:59)CG:	[laughs] I’ll be like, “If I don’t eat nothing all day that’s what I’m eating.” 

(010:04)CHW:	So, well, let’s get your weight first before we =

(010:07)O:	My bra strap is showing {0:10:08} =

(010:08)PT:	But you just took his, he took his weight?  What did he weigh?

(010:12)CG:	242.

(010:14)PT:	He didn’t got up.

(010:16)CG:	Yeah, he’s 6’1”.

(010:17)PT:	He’s 6’1”?

(010:18)CG:	Yeah.

(010:19)PT:	(Really?)  He’s 6’1” one?  Xxxx’s 6’1”.  

(010:23)CG:	That’s what I just say.  Yeah, you 5’6” or something like that.

(010:26)PT:	5’7”.

(010:27)CG:	5’7”.  You’re all tall children.

(010:30)PT:	But he’s 6’1” already.  

(010:32)CG:	Xxxx, Xxxx is 18 =

(010:34)PT:	So?

(010:35)CG:	= and he a boy.  

(010:37)PT:	So?

(010:37)CG:	Boys gain weight differently than girls and unfortunately that’s just how =

(010:40)CHW:	How it goes.

(010:41)CG:	= we was created.  =

(010:43)CHW:	[laughs] That’s true.

(010:44)CG:	= You know, you can blame me for some of that other stuff but =

(010:48)PT:	He {0:10:49} =

(010:49)CHW:	Yeah.  Okay.  I was curious.  Come on, hop on.

(010:54)CG:	Arms to the side.

(011:00)CHW:	Okay.  Last week you weighed 301.8.  This time you weigh 301 so you’ve lost eight-tenths of a pound.  Almost a pound =

(011:12)CG:	Go girl!  I have to give you some gold stars.  

(011:15)PT:	[laughs]

(011:16)CG:	Auntie Xxxx done went from 340 something pounds to 240. =

(011:21)PT:	I know what size, but she  

(011:24)CG:	= She done lost that much weight.

(011:26)PT:	That’s ‘cause she don’t eat junk ‘cause =

(011:27)CG:	No, you know what she did?  She stopped drinking Pepsi.

(011:30)PT:	Well, yeah, ‘cause that’s all she was drinking is Pepsi.

(011:33)CG:	She a diabetic and she stopped drinking Pepsi.  It’s my sister.

(011:34)CHW:	Oh.

(011:36)CG:	She went from 347 pounds, she down to two hundred and something now =

(011:41)CHW:	That’s great.

(011:42)PT:	I thought she was up there anyway.

(011:43)CG:	Yeah, yeah.

(011:44)CHW:	It won’t, you know, =

(011:46)CG:	{0:11:46}

(011:46)CHW:	= we talked about, remember we talked about how one of the things in your folder that helps to cut calories, one of the things is the beverages because if you cut out those sugary beverages they have a lot of calories in them.  So.

(012:02)CG:	You don’t drink pop a lot but you, I mean you drinked it, I drink juice.  

(012:06)O:	Drunk it, {0:12:05} drinked it.

(012:07)CG:	You drunk it but you like juice more, without the cane sugar =

(012:11)CHW:	Yeah, just, you’re right.

(012:13)CG:	And you all drink that, what’s that juice called?  

(012:15)PT:	{0:12:15}

(012:16)CG:	Like your grape juice, you like that but it’s got something with =

(012:18)PT:	I like that, yeah.

(012:19)CG:	No preservatives and…(straight) grape juice.  No sugar =

(012:27)PT:	I’ll just, I’ll be drinking the one that Gran gets {0:12:29}

(012:30)CG:	Well that’s supposed to be good I think.

(012:33)PT:	I don't know but it’s just tart.  {0:12:36}

(012:36)CHW:	Probably doesn’t have the added sugar. [laughs]

(012:38)PT:	{0:12:38} got sugar in it.

(012:39)CG:	That is too dark purple for me.  

(012:41)PT:	I like the orange juice.

(012:42)CG:	Other they need to have when they do a communion.

(012:47)CHW:	[laughs] Okay.

(012:49)PT:	Ma, I see your sausage, your bratwursts on a bun.

(012:53)CG:	Where’d you see that?

(012:54)PT:	It’s 14.

(012:56)CG:	Oh okay, so I can have that.  Well, my thing is on a hamburger.  Oh, even a hamburger is cheaper than the bratwurst, so a hamburger is only 250 calories.

(013:12)CHW:	Two-fifty calories =

(013:13)CG:	Yeah, {0:13:14}.  Now if you get two of them so that’s 500 and the macaroni and cheese you get 150 =

(013:19)PT:	He did like {0:13:19}

(013:22)CHW:	So you know how you guys are counting up the calories?  Today we’re going to start self-monitoring =

(013:25)PT:	Oh,  okay.

(013:27)CHW:	= and with that, and that’s basically what self-monitoring is is monitoring your intake and the calories that you’re consuming.

(013:34)PT:	Okay.

(013:35)CHW:	Okay, so why do you think it might be important to monitor what you’re eating or your physical activity?

(013:46)PT:	So you won’t get =

(013:49)CG:	Bigger 

(013:50)PT:	= bigger and so you could, especially if you like…big.

(013:59)CHW:	So you don’t get bigger, okay.

(014:01)PT:	Yeah.

(014:02)CG:	What you looking at me for?

(014:03)CHW:	Okay, yeah, that’s one reason so that you don’t gain weight, anymore weight, okay. 

(014:07)PT:	So you can keep your weight down especially if it’s a goal.

(014:10)CHW:	Yeah, that’s good. And but there are a few reasons why monitoring your food intake and your physical activity are important =

(014:20)PT:	So you can be healthy.

(014:21)CHW:	So you can be healthy but the number one reason, it gives you a accurate {0:14:24} record of what you’re actually eating or how much physical activity you’re really doing, okay.  So for example, people find out that they usually forget about the small things that they eat or drink during the day, you know, like school starts up.  Your friends say, “Hey, you want some of these cookies?” and they give you a few cookies, right?  But you forget about them ‘cause if you don’t write them down it doesn’t mean those calories don’t count, it just means that you didn’t count them.  So writing things down gives you a real accurate record of what you’re putting in your mouth, okay?  And so it can help you with weight loss because it makes you think more about what you’re eating.  Okay?  And when people start to see what they’re eating through the day sometimes they make better choices.  “I gotta write this down.  Do I really want somebody looking at this.”

(015:24)PT:	Yeah.

(015:26)CHW:	Okay, and how do you think that applies to physical activity?  [pause] You don’t know?

(015:38)PT:	Mm-mm.

(015:41)CHW:	Okay.  Well, if you start tracking your physical activity you might see where you could get more activity in places when you were, you know, when you were active and when you were it’ll you figure out what caused you to be active and what got in the way of you doing it, being active.  So tracking that is helpful, too, okay?  And people who write things down, everything down, they can see these patterns.  They really aren’t clear right now, okay.  What do you think you could learn from writing down your food and your activity?

(016:18)PT:	To eat better  ‘cause I don’t track what I eat or, well, I don’t track what I eat and I don’t want to eat {0:16:28} =

(016:28)CHW:	So you feel that writing the things down will help you eat better? =

(016:32)PT:	Yeah, what I actually eat, and then the time I should eat it.

(016:35)CHW:	Okay, great.

(016:37)CG:	And it also helps you to know what the calories are that you’re going to {0:16:41} =

(016:42)PT:	Yeah.

(016:43)CHW:	That’s true, Mom, that’s a good, good one there.  Okay, and you also might see some other things like the times of the day when you’re more like to overeat, who you’re with when you make healthy or unhealthy choices and how hungry you are, okay?  How do you think that can help you figure out what steps you need to reduce calories?  [pause] You don’t know?

(017:13)PT:	Say that again.

(017:14)CHW:	How do you think writing down what you eat could help you figure out what steps you need to take to reduce calories?

(017:22)PT:	I’m not sure.

(017:23)CHW:	You’re not sure?  Okay.  Well, you might learn that you’ll get most of your calories from sources that surprise you, okay, like the things that you put on a sandwich maybe, the ketchup, the mustard, you know, those toppings like the cheese and those types of things or what you drink, okay.  You might also learn when you get the most of your activity.  Like you might get it at school or you may get it at home.  So monitoring your food and your activity can help you out in a few different ways.  Does that make sense?

(017:58)PT:	Yeah.

(017:59)CHW:	Okay.  And then self-monitoring, it also allow you to see the positive changes that you’re making while you’re making them, okay, because that keeps you motivated a little bit longer.  You think, “Oh wow, I didn’t eat all this junk today.  I went a day without eating candy and potato chips.”  So then you’ll think about that the next day, you’re a little bit more motivated to do without those things, you know, because you’ll see that, “Yeah, I can do without this.”  Whereas maybe before you thought, “Oh, I gotta have me these cookies,” =

(018:36)PT:	Right.

(018:37)CHW:	= “or this candy,” or something like that.  So it’ll help you see those positive changes that you’re making and then, so keeping a self-monitoring log of your food intake and your physical activity will do three main things.  It’ll help by giving you information that’ll make managing your weight easier and it’ll tell us where you need the most help in order to be successful.  And then it’ll give us information that we need to make only the changes that are most likely to help you, okay?  Okay, Mom, so what are your thoughts about the specific ways of having Xxxx do self-monitoring might be helpful for?

(019:32)CG:	I think it’ll help her to like know what she’s intaking, like I said, her amount, and she’ll be able to understand the amount of calories that she’s to keep up with.  She’s supposed to have 1,800 calories.

(019:45)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(019:46)CG:	It’ll give her a rundown of what she’s supposed to be eating and I’m not familiar with the time, but she, at least she’ll know to stay within that range of what she’s supposed to have.  And they say breakfast is the most important meal of the day and don’t skip a meal, so snacks you can skip.  I’m cool with snacks, but breakfast she needs to eat, lunch she needs to eat, dinner she needs to eat and if she keep up with those and calculate them she’ll be on the right track to losing the weight she want to lose.

(020:24)CHW:	Well, that’s true.  Yeah, that’s right.  You know, you made some good points there because, you know, you can, and then when you see her logs, okay, you’re in a better position to help her also ‘cause you can see the areas where she’s making changes and where she needs extra help, =

(020:40)CG:	She just got to be truthful.

(020:42)PT:	I am.

(020:43)CHW:	= you know, and the encouragement is needed, okay =

(020:46)CG:	Did she tell you how I woke her up this morning?

(020:48)CHW:	No.

(020:49)CG:	I was like, “Xxxx, get up!” =

(020:50)PT:	Uh, yeah.

(020:51)CG:	= “Get up, Xxxx!  Get up and do your jumping jacks.  Get up.” 

(020:54)CHW:	[laughs] 

(020:56)CG:	She was like, “No!”  

(020:57)PT:	[laughs] 

(020:59)CG:	This was at ten o’clock this morning. [laughs]

(021:01)CHW:	Well, you’ll be getting up early in the morning anyway. [laughs]

(021:04)CG:	Uh-huh.  Might as well get back used to it.  =

(021:06)CHW:	Yeah, it’s a good thing.

(021:07)CG:	= And she’ll be walking to the bus stop =

(021:08)CHW:	J- you know

(021:09)CG:	= and no more carrying, trying to find a ride.  No, baby.

(021:12)PT:	I had service last year.

(021:16)CG:	Yeah, last year that’s how she probably put on some pounds.  She had a cab service, yeah.

(021:20)CHW:	Oh, did you?

(021:22)PT:	‘Cause I was two something.

(021:24)CG:	Two what?

(021:28)CHW:	You had a cab?

(021:38)CG:	They offer it for the IEP, if you have a IEP.

(021:42)PT:	Long-distance people.

(021:43)CHW:	Oh, okay.  Okay, well, so you’ll be getting a little more activity =

(021:51)CG:	{0:21:53}

(021:52)CHW:	= every day.

(021:53)PT:	Yeah.  Plus the stairs.

(021:56)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(021:57)CG:	Yeah, she got to go on the fifth floor, fourth floor, third floor.

(022:00)CHW:	An no elevator, huh?

(022:02)PT:	No elevator.

(022:03)CG:	Yes, it is but {0:22:02} for =

(022:05)CHW:	They don’t let you use it unless you need, got a doctor’s (rest), =

(022:07)CG:	{0:22:05}

(022:08)CHW:	= excuse or something like that.  =

(022:09)PT:	Yeah.

(022:10)CHW:	= That’s usually how that goes {0:22:10} =

(022:11)PT:	Yeah.  I’m going to say I got bad feet.

(022:12)CHW:	Yeah.

(022:13)PT:	I do.

(022:15)CHW:	So if it’s okay with you I’d like to go over the things that you learned during the session, some of those tools that you used with Jenny, because those are going to help you with self-monitoring.  So you’ve got your CalorieKing book =

(022:29)CG:	Yeah.

(022:30)CHW:	= and your folder, okay, and ‘cause you can use those three sources to get ideas about the calories in the foods that you’re eating, okay.

(022:43)CG:	She can pick out, and once you get used to using that book you can pretty much pick out your own meal plan.

(022:48)PT:	I looked at it for applesauce.

(022:51)CHW:	Okay.  Now because, you know, Jenny taught you how to use the food labels, read the food labels, and it’s always better to read the label if there is one, but sometimes things don’t have the food label and then when you’re at school that food doesn’t have a label on it also, like if they serve pizza you wouldn’t  know, you know, there’s no food label on that slice of pizza, okay.  And then when you eat homemade foods or foods at restaurants a lot of times you don’t know how many calories are in those foods, okay.  So the first tool that the CalorieKing book there will be good for those types of situations, okay?  And we’re going to go over how to use it.  And then you talked with Jenny about, you know, how eating large portions of foods even healthy foods they can cause people to =

(023:39)PT:	Gain weight.

(023:40)CHW:	Right.  Because they’ll eat more calories than they need.  And so the portion size guide which is in here, did you get familiar with it?  No, not yet.

(023:50)PT:	No, not really.

(023:52)CHW:	Okay.  That’ll help you, okay.  And ‘cause you can compare your portion sizes to everyday items like a computer mouse or the deck of cards, okay.  And then the third tool is the list of how many calories you burn for a certain amount of physical activity such as walking, climbing stairs, and other types of exercises or working out.  So now that we’ve gone over those let’s get started learning how to do self-monitoring.  So first though, you have a choice of which, if you’d like to learn first for food or for physical activity because whichever one you don’t choose we’ll do that next time after we do the review, so which =

(024:40)CG:	Which is like making out her a menu or something?

(024:43)CHW:	No, we’re going to, she’s going to learn how to do self-monitoring.

(024:46)CG:	Oh.

(024:47)PT:	Self-monitor how long and how much I should do?

(024:50)CHW:	For physical activity, yeah.

(024:51)PT:	Oh.

(024:52)CG:	You want to do that one or the food?

(024:54)PT:	Physical.

(024:56)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  Which one?

(024:57)PT:	Physical.

(024:58)CHW:	Okay, so we’ll do that first then, okay?  And so most people find it helpful to start going over what to write in each section of the log and watching me fill it out, okay.  How does that sound to you?  Okay.  And so we’re going to start with the physical activity log.  So one for each of you and =

(025:30)CG:	{0:25:32}

(025:31)PT:	Self-monitoring physical activity.

(025:38)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  First thing here is you see that there’s a day, there’s a column for the day and then the next column asks,  “What lifestyle activities and exercise did I do today?” and then “How long did I do the activity or exercise today?”  And then, “How vigorous was the activity or exercise and the calories burned for?”  And, “How long did I spend on screen time?”  Do you remember what screen time is?

(026:10)PT:	Yeah, television, computer, the games, and all that stuff.

(026:18)CHW:	Yeah, and the telephone, very good.

(026:19)PT:	Yeah, telephone.

(026:23)CHW:	Okay, so what I want to do is I’m going to do one and I’m going to—how we learn new skills in this program is I’ll do an example, okay, and I’ll say it out loud as I’m doing it and then I will have you tell me the steps and then you’ll do an example.  Okay?

(026:43)PT:	Okay.

(026:44)CHW:	Okay.  So today is Wednesday so what lifestyle and exercises did I do today?  

(026:56)PT:	Oh, you asking me?

(026:57)CHW:	Oh no, =

(026:58)CG:	She give you an example first.

(026:59)CHW:	= I’m going to give you an example.  So today I worked out before I went to work so I got up, and I rode my bike for 15 minutes.  So I write that down =

(027:16)CG:	You rode bike, okay.

(027:22)CHW:	And how long did I do the activity for?  Was 15 minutes.  And how vigorous was the activity or exercise?  Well, it was moderate, okay, I wasn’t trying to run a race or anything so it was moderate. And how many calories burned?  So it was 15 minutes now 22 minutes for moderate burns 100 calories so I did 15 so we could say about 75, 80 calories.  So I’m going to say 80 calories there, okay?  And then I did some, just some aerobics for about 20 minutes, okay?  Twenty minutes and that was pretty vigorous, so I’m going to circle the V.  Now 15 minutes of vigorous activity burns 100 calories =

(028:27)CG:	100 calories.

(028:28)CHW:	= so we’ll say like make that 105.  So that’s pretty much it for my physical activity.  I’ve walked but that’s, you know, I can’t really count walking from the car to the office building from the parking lot, so I’ve burned 185 calories today, okay.

(028:55)PT:	That’s a lot.

(028:57)CHW:	And I haven’t watched any television yet so I’m not going to circle any televisions, okay.  So you want to tell me what I did?  Tell me the steps to take.

(029:07)PT:	Oh.  You {0:29:09} when you first up, you got up =

(029:13)CHW:	No, tell me the steps to take if you were going to do this.  So what would you do?

(029:52)CHW:	You can just tell me the steps right now. 

(029:53)PT:	Okay.

(029:57)PT:	Write your plan =

(029:58)CHW:	Okay, and then what?

(030:00)PT:	= and then write how long you did it and then you write, I mean you circle was it =

(040:55)CHW:	Okay.  All that adds up.  You lost eight-tenths of a pound so you’re doing good.  Today actually we’re going to, another thing we’re going to do is just set a weight loss goal for you for each week, too, okay?

(041:16)PT:	The stairs was about…moderate.

(041:23)CHW:	Okay.  

(041:28)PT:	Pushups was moderate.

(041:34)CHW:	So how was that to report everything?  Now you’re aware of what you did, huh?

(041:43)PT:	Yeah.

(041:44)CHW:	Okay, great.  Now you may be wondering how much time it takes to do this and actually it doesn’t take that much time once you get used to it.  You be, usually you’ll get faster.

(041:58)CG:	Just for that half a hour that was.  

(042:04)PT:	{0:42:03} vigorous.

(042:05)CG:	You said vigorous for the workout, for the =

(042:08)PT:	Oh, yeah.

(042:09)CG:	Right so that’s a half an hour =

(042:11)PT:	But that was for the {0:42:13}

(042:12)CG:	= but this says 15 minutes so you got to do what?  Did you =

(042:19)CHW:	What- no, she did a half an hour of vigorous activity, so for 15 minutes she burned a hundred calories, so you =

(042:27)CG:	Right, so it’s just for an hour =

(042:29)CHW:	For an hour at vigorous, that is 400 calories.

(042:34)CG:	Yeah, but she only did a half an hour.

(042:36)CHW:	So that would be 200 calories.

(042:38)PT:	That’s what I thought.  I put 200.

(042:39)CG:	Did you know how she got that?

(042:41)PT:	No.

(042:43)CG:	‘Cause 15 and 15, add that, is 30, okay, and 30 minutes is half of an hour.  Did you know that?

(042:53)CHW:	Every 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour.

(042:55)PT:	Yeah.

(042:56)CHW:	Okay?

(042:58)CG:	So like when you were saying an hour ‘cause I think that’s what’s going to throw her off.

(043:04)CHW:	Okay.

(043:05)CG:	When you said an hour and a half like 60 minutes is an hour, right?

(043:10)PT:	Mm-hmm.  So 60 times =

(043:14)CG:	For a half, no, like for this one, the moderate was 22 minutes.  Oh no, I’m sorry.  Yeah, that’s right. =

(043:23)CHW:	Yeah, you’re right.

(043:24)CG:	= Yeah, 22 minutes so =

(043:29)PT:	I hate when they do that, too.

(043:30)CG:	So why was I saying it was 30 though?

(043:35)CHW:	‘Cause she did it for like…

(043:41)CG:	Oh, okay.  So that’s how she got 300 because she did 30 and 30, that’s, and then a half.

(043:51)CHW:	Right.  

(043:54)CG:	So that’s how she got times three.  Well, times, I’m sorry times 100.  Three times 100.

(044:03)CHW:	So what questions do you have about completing the activity log?

(044:08)CG:	It’s easy.

(044:09)PT:	It’s easy once I do it.  Like I do the math actually =

(044:13)CHW:	Okay, yeah, once you get, yeah, do the math, get used to it, it’ll be easier for you.  Okay, now that you know how to fill it out we should decide when you’re going to fill it out each day.  What time do you think works best for you?

(044:29)PT:	When I get home.

(044:31)CHW:	When you get home from school?

(044:33)PT:	Yeah, well =

(044:34)CG:	So about six.

(044:35)PT:	About six?

(044:38)PT:	Oh, yeah.  

(044:39)CHW:	Well, okay, you want to do your homework first or would you like to do your exercises first? =

(044:47)PT:	Homework.  Homework ‘cause if I don’t do my homework I ain’t going to do it.

(044:55)CG:	So if you get home at four, you eat a, that’s where a snack come in at.  

(044:58)CHW:	Okay.

(044:59)CG:	So if you get home at four, you get your snack, =

(045:03)CHW:	Good job writing the plan out.

(045:07)CG:	= you start your homework, =

(045:09)PT:	{0:45:10}

(045:12)CG:	= and then 6:00PM you’re going to do your workout…and then they say you’re supposed to be eating what, eat two hours apart? 

(045:27)CHW:	What?

(045:28)CG:	By eight o’clock she’ll be eating dinner.  Is that too late?

(045:31)CHW:	At eight o’clock.  Well, yeah, I think, you know, =

(045:35)CG:	See, ‘cause {0:45:37}

(045:37)CHW:	= because what time do you go to bed? =
	
(045:39)PT:	Ten.

(045:40)CHW:	Okay.  So kind of want to let your food digest =

(045:44)CG:	Digest, right.

(045:45)CHW:	= before you go to bed and, no, I’m not going to advocate you stay up later but maybe =

(045:51)CG:	Probably about seven?

(045:52)CHW:	Yeah, eat a little bit earlier, give food time to digest.  So maybe after you do your workout you can =

(045:59)CG:	7PM dinner.

(046:00)CHW:	Yeah.  Do you know—can I tell you something about exercise?  It cuts down on your appetite, it reduces your appetite.  So at seven o’clock when you get through working out and you’re getting ready to eat you’ll eat less because your appetite won’t be as great then ten o’clock you go to bed, you’ll go to bed full still but it’ll have time to start digesting.  But your appetite will be reduced so that sounds like oh, excuse me, sounds like a good plan.

(046:31)CG:	Well, {0:46:29} dinner?  ‘Cause it’s the, we’ll have to make a meal plan.

(046:38)PT:	What’s that breakfast we’re doing now?

(051:58)PT:	Yeah.

(052:00)CHW:	Okay, because a lot of times kids don’t like taking their logs to school ‘cause =

(052:04)PT:	I’m going to take it ‘cause I forget.

(052:05)CHW:	= they don’t want people to know what they’re doing.  So you’re going to take yours to school with you?

(053:35)CHW:	So can I give you some information?  Okay, well, in this program one to two pounds a week =

(053:41)PT:	Is good?

(053:42)CHW:	Is good, it’s a healthy weight loss.  Now some weeks you might lose four or five pounds especially since, you know, you’re just now getting active and I can imagine like that first week when you do that ROTC for three days =

(053:54)CG:	[laughs] Yeah.

(053:56)PT:	I might lose a pound or two or three =

(053:57)CHW:	= [laughs] And they’re working you like you’ve never worked before, you might just lose five pounds that week, okay, but on the norm, on the average, one to two pounds, okay, a week is a healthy weight loss because some of your weight loss is going to come from the physical activity and =

(054:16)PT:	Like walking?

(054:17)CHW:	Yeah, and then some of it is going to come by making the changes to your diet.  So one to two pounds is a healthy weight loss.  What do you guys think about that?

(054:29)PT:	I like it.

(054:30)CHW:	You like it?  What do you think, Mom?

(054:32)CG:	That’s good.

So you learned how to fill how the physical activity log today and you got a plan for when you’re going to fill it out and we’ve already got your exercise plan in place for you, okay.  And some things that can get in your way is you might forget but your mom says she’s going to remind you.

(057:26)CHW:	Okay, and so Mom, your job is to like review her logs to see that she’s, you know, working on her activities and everything and I’ve only got the one here, so I will =

(057:41)CG:	I’m trying to tell her to get up at ten o’clock.

(057:43)CHW:	= bring you some more of these =

(057:44)PT:	Mom.

(057:46)CG:	I tell her to get up at ten o’clock. =

(057:48)PT:	{0:57:49}

(057:49)CHW:	I’ll bring you more of these, okay, so right now we’re just going to work on food.  So your job is for each day this is an evaluation sheet for her, okay?  So what you do is like make sure she’s got the activity recorded at the time that she did it, that she recorded that, and that she described it well—what she did, the length of time, if it was moderate, if it was mild, if it was vigorous, and the calories that she burned—that she wrote that down for each activity.  And then also what she did well about recording the things on her logs and what things does she need to improve, =

(058:40)CG:	Improve.

(058:41)CHW:	= okay?  So any =

(058:42)CG:	Write longer, I can already know what {0:58:42}

(058:44)CHW:	Hmm?

(058:46)CG:	Longer time you spend on them.  Five minutes, more =

(058:51)PT:	I spent a long time doing that mile thingy.

(058:54)CG:	Yeah, if you want to do that every day.

(058:57)PT:	And that’s easier than {0:58:58} =

(058:58)CG:	But for the whole three miles, don’t do that one half-mile.  Do the whole thing. =

(059:02)CHW:	Well, she probably has to want to build up to it.  It sounds like it was pretty intense. =

(059:06)PT:	It was.

(059:09)CG:	I got to see it.  Go get it so we can see it. =

(059:10)PT:	No, I was sweating.

(059:11)CG:	Sweating is good, it’s burning off calories.  Sweat ain’t nothing but water.  Then you go take a shower.

(059:18)PT:	It was, I got {0:59:18} =

(059:20)CG:	Took a shower right after.

(059:21)CHW:	[laughs] Did you?  Okay.

(059:22)PT:	Yeah, it was a lot of sweat.

(059:23)CG:	That I pay for anyway, so take a shower.  Sweat is good.

(059:27)PT:	I did.

(059:29)CHW:	Okay, and you know, but once you get used to doing it you probably won’t start to sweat until a little bit later =

(059:34)CG:	And you got, {0:59:35} forget water.

(059:36)CHW:	And yeah, drink plenty of water =

(059:38)CG:	Drink your water.

(059:39)PT:	I need to buy another one ‘cause {0:59:40}.

(059:42)CHW:	Yeah, always drink plenty of water so you don’t get dehydrated, okay?

(059:46)PT:	Yeah.

(059:49)CHW:	So any questions about anything?

(059:51)PT:	{0:59:50}

(059:53)CG:	Oh wait a minute, so wait =

(059:54)PT:	None for me anyway.

(059:55)CG:	= we just doing the activity {0:59:54} =

(059:56)CHW:	Right, we’re just 

(059:57)CG:	= {0:59:54} food was {0:59:54}, okay.

(059:58)CHW:	We’re just working on changes to =

(059:59)CG:	So it’s just activity, exercise, 

(060:01)CHW:	= physical activity right now and then next week what we’ll do is we’ll start =

(060:04)CG:	Oh, that’s {1:00:03} at the bottom, okay.

(060:06)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  We’ll start working on self-monitoring for food.

(060:10)CG:	So what’d she say her weight goal is?

(060:13)CHW:	Well, her weight goal is one to two pounds a week is a weight loss goal =

(060:19)CG:	Well, what’s the weight she want to try to get down to?

(060:21)CHW:	Well, we don’t really set =

(060:22)PT:	We’re not sure yet.

(060:24)CHW:	= weight loss goals like, “I’m going to get down to this size,” because she’s still growing.

(060:24)CG:	She better stop.

(060:24)PT:	Thanks, Mom.

(060:24)CHW:	[laughs] You’re how old?  

(060:24)PT:	I’m 15.

(060:34)CHW:	You’re 15 =

(060:35)CG:	Fifteen.

(060:36)CHW:	Okay, she’s got at least another three years and she may just shoot up like her brother and be six feet tall.

(060:41)CG:	{1:00:39} =

(060:42)PT:	He’s 6’1” for real now=

(060:43)CHW:	So I can’t =

(060:44)CG:	{1:00:43}

(060:45)PT:	I know.

(060:46)CHW:	= we can’t say, you know, “You need to be 110 pounds or 120 pounds,” because if she were 6’1” and weighed =

(060:52)CG:	{1:00:52}

(060:53)CHW:	= 100 and, right, you got it, you know.  So we don’t give weight loss in pounds and things like that =

(060:59)CG:	Okay.

(061:00)CHW:	The goal is for her to learn how to lose weight while she’s in the program, to lose weight and continue losing weight once the six months are up so that she can be healthy.  

(061:12)CG:	Right.

(061:14)CHW:	But I can give you if you’d like some information on what teens can actually lose during the course of the program if you’d like that.  If they really work, would you like that type of information?

(061:24)CG:	You got {1:01:25} =

(061:25)PT:	Yeah, if you really work, what- how, if you really work =

(061:28)CHW:	Now the program is 26 weeks and so the teens can lose really anywhere between 20 to 30 pounds during that time if they’re really working on it and doing the things.

(061:44)CG:	Do you have any other clients you have have done got that goal?

(061:46)CHW:	Yeah.  Mm-hmm, I have.

(061:50)CG:	She probably needs somebody to talk to like of her peers that’s already been there =

(061:56)CHW:	We’re not allowed to do that because of confidentiality and the fact that it’s a research program.  But you know, you might want to look online like I’m sure there’s some social support-like networks like that on Facebook for weight loss routines and things like that.  You might be able to talk to some other teens who are trying to lose weight and things like that for support, but that would be nice but the way the program is set up because of confidentiality we can’t do that.  But have you got any friends who are trying to lose weight, Xxxx?

(062:32)PT:	My friends skinny =

(062:33)CHW:	Your friends are skinny.  Well, maybe =

(062:36)PT:	{1:02:36}

(062:37)CHW:	= you’ll meet some bigger friends at the new school and you can get them to help you work out and lose weight, you know, for support. =

(062:43)CG:	Trying {1:02:43} always like that, all my friends were small.

(062:47)PT:	Mom, I mean =

(062:48)CG:	Were small.

(062:49)PT:	I know {1:02:47}, but they eat everything. =

(062:50)CG:	One of my best friends always was in the size zero.

(062:53)PT:	Zero, come on {1:02:56}

(062:55)CHW:	Yeah, I know, but…

(063:00)CG:	But can eat a slam dunk, a whole large pizza to herself.

(063:04)CHW:	They have that high metabolism or something, I know =

(063:08)CG:	I eat one piece and I’m blown up.

(063:09)CHW:	[laughs]

(063:11)CG:	I did the same things they did.  I ran, jumped, skipped, hopped, chased the boys, beat the boys up, you know, did everything they did, but I still =

(063:19)PT:	Oh {1:03:19}

(063:20)CG:	= gained the weight.

(063:21)CHW:	Even today, my best friend, she’s slender.  And so I’m trying to lose weight, she comes over another week and I fix us dinner and we do like, I did some chicken wings, some buffalo wings, and some salad.  A few hours later she says, “I’m hungry.”  I’m like, =

(063:36)CG:	Yeah, {1:03:36} 

(063:37)CHW:	“You hungry.”  “You fed me that rabbit food,” [laughs] =

(063:39)PT:	That’s how Xxxx is.

(063:41)CG:	Oh my God!  

(063:42)PT:	That’s how…

(063:43)CG:	That’s like him.  He can eat a whole hog and still be =

(063:44)CHW:	I wasn’t even hungry.

(063:45)CG:	= he’s still skinny.

(063:46)CHW:	Yeah.

(063:48)PT:	That’s how Xxxx is.

(063:48)CHW:	And some people {1:03:49} =

(063:50)CG:	{1:03:48} and he’d be like, “Don’t hate the player, hate the high metabolism.”

(063:52)CHW:	[laughs]

(063:54)CG:	He kill me with that saying {1:03:53} =

(063:55)CHW:	But some people are like that, you know =

(063:57)CG:	Yeah.

(063:58)CHW:	= but she’s like, {1:03:59}

(064:00)CG:	I was going to say God didn’t make everybody to be the same size ‘cause if he did we’d all look alike, too.  

(064:04)CHW:	That’s true.

(064:05)CG:	So we all have to be different in some kind of way, form, or fashion.  That’s how we create our own identity.

(064:12)CHW:	That’s true.  Yeah, but some people, you know, I mean a few hours away we’re at a restaurant and she’s pigging out =

(064:19)CG:	She {1:04:20} 

(064:21)PT:	[laughs]

(064:22)CHW:	[laughs] “Now I’ll just have a piece of cheesecake and you can share it with me.” [laughs] 

(064:26)CG:	Right, no.

(064:29)CHW:	They got the full meal. =

(064:29)CG:	{1:04:29}

(064:31)CHW:	No, no, it was a pretty big piece of cheesecake, so.

(064:33)CG:	Here put these in your notebook.

(064:35)CHW:	Actually we both ate off of it twice so, =

(064:38)CG:	Oh, okay.

(064:40)CHW:	= but yeah, that night and then the next day.  But yeah, she’s got that high metabolism and stuff.

(064:47)CG:	Yeah, I don't have that high metabolism.  If I did ‘cause I played touch football with the boys, chased them, did everything but I’m still =

(064:54)PT:	You was just a boy.

(064:55)CG:	Yeah, ‘cause I’m.

(064:57)CHW:	Do you know what I notice though about people who are slender naturally like that?  They move all the time.  If you watch them, =

(065:04)CG:	Yeah, {1:05:04}

(065:05)CHW:	= they’re constantly burning calories and that’s the trick, just to stay active and keep moving because they are moving all the time. =

(065:13)CG:	Even when they’re sitting down they moving.

(065:15)CHW:	You’re right.  Their legs are moving, lord =

(065:17)CG:	Yeah, especially when {1:05:18}  playing that game. 

(065:19)CHW:	Or they’re fiddling with something, but even if you do this that burns some calories.  

(065:25)PT:	{1:05:25} do all the time.

(065:26)CHW:	Yeah.  So they’re constantly moving.  Okay, so that’s all I’ve got for you guys today.  I’ll see you.  Thanks for meeting with me.
