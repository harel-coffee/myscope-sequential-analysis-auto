(002:00)CHW:	And dance?  Okay.  That’s good.  Activity is good.  Oh, let me just tell you a little bit about the program.  Okay, well, you know this is a family program so we’ll all be working together to figure out the best things for Xxxx to help her with weight loss, and we will meet twice a week.  Okay?  Once during the week, the first session, it’ll be a lesson, and then the next session there’ll be a review to make sure you didn’t miss anything, because each session builds on the other for weight loss and it’s education.  We provide a lot of education on things that will help people lose weight.  Any questions so far?

(002:44)PT:	No.

(002:45)CHW:	Okay, and our first couple of sessions will meet, you know, there’ll be a nutritionist with our next session that we’ll meet with and you’ll meet, then I’ll meet with you.  And then we’ll meet again with the nutritionist to basically help you.  You’ll learn about food and physical activity.  Have you ever done anything like this before?

(003:12)PT:	Mm-mm.

(003:13)CHW:	Okay.  And I left something in the car.  I’m just trying to, I don’t want to, I’m trying to make sure I don’t forget to cover anything with you guys.  Okay, so … so how do you feel about your weight?

(003:38)PT:	Not good.

(003:40)CHW:	Not good?  What’s wrong?

(003:42)CG:	Stop {0:03:41}.

(003:44)PT:	Uh…I’m too big and most of my clothes I can’t fit.

(003:53)CHW:	Oh, you can’t fit a lot of your clothes and you want to be able to fit your stuff, huh?

(003:57)PT:	Yeah.

(003:58)CHW:	Okay, that’s a good reason right there [laughs] to want to lose weight, okay.  Were there any questions that you, was there anything you wanted to talk about?  Okay.  Is it okay if I meet with her for a few minutes by herself and [laughs] okay.

(004:21)CG:	{0:04:21}.

(004:22)CHW:	Okay. [laughs] So you were saying that you don’t feel good about your weight?

(004:27)PT:	No.

(004:29)CHW:	Okay, because your clothes don’t fit?

(004:32)PT:	Most of them don’t.

(004:33)CHW:	Most of your clothes don’t fit?  Okay.  And any other things?

(004:37)PT:	Mm-mm.

(004:39)CHW:	Okay, so, but you’re a growing girl so, and you’re, are you ready to lose weight?  Is this something you’re ready to do?  Okay.  How come?  Just because the clothes don’t fit or?

(004:53)PT:	Yeah, ‘cause most of the time I feel like sometimes when I walk upstairs, when I get up the stairs I can’t breathe, so {0:05:03}, and then when I wake up, when I stand up my feet hurt and when, before I gained weight and my feet didn’t do that.

(005:15)CHW:	Okay.  You gained weight before?  And did you lose some of the weight?  Okay, so when you gained weight the first time your feet didn’t hurt, but now your feet hurt and you think it’s too much weight on your feet.

(005:30)PT:	Yeah.

(005:31)CHW:	So you lost the weight before?  How did you do it?

(005:36)PT:	Sport- like I used to be in cheerleading.  I used to do a lot.  I used to do a lot of ga- like physical games at my school and I used to (like going) a lot.  But now when I go somewhere or go get, or do something, I run.

(005:57)CHW:	Oh, that’s good. [laughs]  So you said you used to do these things at school.  How come you’re not doing it anymore?

(006:06)PT:	I don’t know, ‘cause sometimes when I try to run, my knee, when I try- I get tired real fast.

(006:11)CHW:	Okay, so that’s why you stopped doing the sports?

(006:15)PT:	Mmm, because of asthma, so.

(006:17)CHW:	Oh, because of the asthma, okay.  And but your doctor said it was okay for you to exercise?

(006:25)PT:	Yeah.

(006:26)CHW:	Okay, so did he, you mentioned {0:06:28} so that you- did he ask if you could start, did he say you can start back doing your sports and things?

(006:34)PT:	Yeah, ‘cause I…the last time I went to the doctor they said I couldn’t do a lot, I couldn’t go to the gym for like a week, because I hurt myself.  I hurt, I was constipated so I couldn’t do a lot of things and then I…this year I hurt my shoulder, so and then I hurt, then I had got stitches in my knee, so I couldn’t anymore.

(007:03)CHW:	Whoa, what did you do to hurt your shoulder and get stitches in your knee?

(007:07)PT:	‘Cause {0:07:05} was playing, he ran into the fridgerator and a mug fell on the floor and then a piece of, when it hit the counter, then it fell on the floor and it slit my knee.

(007:18)CHW:	Ooh.  I know that must have hurt.

(007:21)PT:	I didn’t feel that when it cut me, but then I looked down.  I started crying.

(007:27)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  It was a lot of blood?

(007:28)PT:	Yeah.

(007:29)CHW:	Oh, wow, that was scary, wasn’t it?  Okay, so and your shoulder?  You said you hurt your shoulder?

(007:35)PT:	I was, fell up the stairs.

(007:39)CHW:	You fell up the stairs?

(007:41)PT:	Yeah, I tripped, I tripped over, I tripped, I was like just slip, I’m like, so I’m like this.

(007:46)CHW:	Oh, okay, and hurt your shoulder, okay.

(007:50)PT:	Yeah, landed like this.

(007:52)CHW:	Ooh.  Awkward.

(007:54)PT:	Yeah, and like this.

(007:57)CHW:	And so, yeah, I can imagine that really did hurt a lot, okay.  Now, can I tell you a little bit about the program?

(008:04)PT:	Yeah.

(008:05)CHW:	Okay, well, like I was saying, we’re going to be meeting twice a week and like I said, the first time you’ll get a lesson—hi—and then the next time I’ll come back and we’ll do a review, go over the things that you learned, make sure I didn’t, you know, miss anything like that, okay?  And we’ll be meeting with you and your mom together, okay?  You wonder why we’ll be doing that?

(008:32)PT:	No.

(008:33)CHW:	No?  You don’t have any questions about why we’re meeting with you and your mom?

(008:38)PT:	No.

(008:39)CHW:	Okay.  Because well, I’ll just tell you.  Your mom will be, you know, helping you with your weight loss, so we’ll be meeting together, okay?  And now the program is six months long.

(008:52)PT:	Hmm?

(008:53)CHW:	It’s six months long, okay?  So this is April… =

(009:00)PT:	Eighteenth.

(009:02)CHW:	Yeah, so we’ll be through about October, right after you start back to school.  How do you feel about that?

(009:11)PT:	Good.

(009:12)CHW:	Okay, and there will be some assignments for you to do after our sessions, okay?  And there just, it’s not going to be a lot of {0:09:19} or anything like that.  And so you’re saying you wanted to lose weight so that your clothes will fit? =

(009:27)PT:	Yeah.

(009:28)CHW:	= And you’ll feel better about yourself?

(009:30)PT:	Yeah.

(009:31)CHW:	Okay, that’s good reasons, you know?  But I’ve got something here.  {0:09:36} [pause]
 Okay, well, I’ll tell you what.  I’d like to talk to your mom now.  Okay?  And actually I left something in the car.  I got to go back and get it because I got something I need you to fill out for me, but I parked really close, so I will be … right back, okay? 

(010:28) [pause]

[crosstalk]

(011:38)CHW:	While I meet with your mom could you fill this out for me?  Okay?  It’s just a goal statement and a change plan and you just want to tell us why you want to lo- your plan is to lose weight and why you want to do that.  And if something gets in your way, you know, list the things that’ll get in your way and then the things that you might try, okay?  And then just the first step and then something somebody could do to help you lose weight.  Okay?  (Could) you fill that out for me while I talk to your mom?  Okay.  You need a pen or something?

(012:22)PT:	Yeah.

(012:23)CHW:	Let’s see.  I should have one.  Here you go.  (But) in the other room so I can talk to your mom by herself, (so) okay.  So how do you feel about her weight?

(012:46)CG:	Especially her eating, it’s not her weight per se, it’s just her eating habits.

(012:50)CHW:	Her eating habits?  So probably she eat a lot of junk or skips meals or =

(012:55)CG:	She just eat a lot of food, period.

(012:57)CHW:	Okay. [laughs]

(012:59)CG:	A lot of food, period.

(013:00)CHW:	[laughs] Okay.  You feel that she doesn’t practice portion control.

(013:05)CG:	Mm-mm.  And like she don’t like vegetables.  She like, we try to eat salads a lot.  We do eat salads a lot.  She won’t eat it.

(013:14)CHW:	She won’t eat them.

(013:16)CG:	“I don’t like that.  I don’t like that.”  So we was like, “Okay, well, what you don’t like in it?”  “I don’t like cucumbers and tomatoes.”  I said, “Okay, well, find something else you want to put in it.”  I said, “You can get some strawberries to put in it.  You can put grapes in it.”

(013:29)CHW:	That’s true.

(013:31)CG:	“If you want grilled chicken, I can put you some grilled chicken in it.”  She don’t eat.  And then like I can’t punish the other kids, you know, like I buy tub of cookie dough.  We had a night when we had cookies or whatever, and she’ll eat the cookie dough {0:13:50}, just eat the cookie dough.

(013:52)CHW:	Oh.  Raw.

(013:54)CG:	Mm-hmm.  Or I could have pop, well now I have to drink diet pop, but somebody have anything in there that’s not everybody’s, she’ll drink it and then say, “Oh, I didn’t drink it.”  And we know.  She used to take food and hide in her room and eat it.

(014:13)CHW:	Okay.

(014:14)CG:	She done stopped that because I go in there and I look a lot now, so =

(014:18)CHW:	Mm-hmm.   So you’re checking.

(014:20)CG:	Yeah.  Then like if I do buy snacks and stuff, I have them in my room and they don’t go in there and get it.

(014:26)CHW:	Okay.

(014:28)CG:	I haven’t bought cereal in about three months.  They’ve been on Cheerios, that’s it.  Cheerios and oatmeal.  They won’t eat the oatmeal ‘cause I still got a whole box and a half a box, so they eating =

(014:41)CHW:	Of oatmeal, but they’ll eat the Cheerios.

(014:43)CG:	Mm-hmm.  They’ll eat the Cheerios.  It just, when she eat, she just glut and then a week later you be like, “You can’t fit in them pants no more.”  Then she go to the doctor, then her feelings be hurt ‘cause she done gained five, six pounds =

(015:06)CHW:	Pounds

(015:08)CG:	= then she gets to where she don’t want to eat and I told her, “No, you got to eat.  You just have to watch how much you have to eat.”  I’m a diabetic now, so it’s a lot of stuff that I can’t have.

(015:18)CHW:	Right.  Okay.

(015:19)CG:	So like I don’t eat, I don’t buy white bread.  Everybody have to eat wheat bread.  I don’t eat pork and I stopped eating a lot of beef, but I don’t take that away from them, =

(015:31)CHW:	Right.

(015:32)CG:	= if that’s what they want.

(015:33)CHW:	Want.

(015:34)CG:	They can have it.  I just choose not to.

(015:35)CHW:	Not to.

(015:36)CG:	And I eat a lot of baked food and I try to get her to eat what I eat.

(015:39)CHW:	Okay, so you’ve made, what I’m hearing you say is that you’ve made a lot of changes to =

(015:43)CG:	Mm-hmm.

(015:44)CHW:	= your eating habits so that you are trying to eat healthier, =

(015:45)CG:	(Yeah)

(015:47)CHW:	= trying to get the kids to do the same thing, =

(015:49)CG:	(Yeah)

(015:50)CHW:	= which is great, you know.  It really is.

(015:52)CG:	I’m trying.  Like today is one of my bad days ‘cause like I had junk food in my head.  That’s all I want is junk food.  This is as far as I got.

(016:02)CHW:	Well, if you stop right there you’re doing good. [laughs]

(016:05)CG:	As far as I got, no, I didn’t go, well, they (ain’t going to) get my sweet potato pie, so I know it’s over.

(016:09)CHW:	Okay. [laughs]

(016:12)CG:	Like they had brownies yesterday.  I didn’t eat none.

(016:15)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(016:16)CG:	I’m not saying how many she ate ‘cause I wasn’t down here, so.

(016:19)CHW:	Okay.  Well, can you tell me, so what do you remember about the program?

(016:30)CG:	Y’all going to help me with like teaching her different ways to eat different foods—healthier foods, I should say—get her like on a exercise regimen.

(016:47)CHW:	Yeah, we will work on her doing a exercise regimen.

(016:51)CG:	And I’ll see Tonia in three months.

(016:53)CHW:	Okay. [laughs]

(016:56)CG:	Because the lady came and did our blood draw the other morning.  And I think it’s like three to six months or something before we =

(017:04)CHW:	The program’s six months long.

(017:06)CG:	Yeah, six months and then the third, like the third or fourth month I meet back with Tonia?

(017:10)CHW:	Yeah, you will.  And what happens is the first three months I’ll be coming to you guys twice a week, well, for the whole program pretty much we’ll meet twice a week unless she goes into what’s called “Relapse Prevention” in the second half.  But the first half of the program is three months long, okay, and twice a week, we meet twice a week.  I’ll come out and we’ll do a lesson and then I’ll do a review when I come back, just make sure that she learned all of the things that she was taught the first session, because each session builds on the other one.  And then at three months she’ll get randomized, which is sort of like putting names in a hat and deciding, “Okay, you go here, you go there.”  Okay, unless she loses 3% of her body weight.  If she does that in the first three months, she’ll go into what’s called “Relapse Prevention” and she’ll be taught how to keep from gaining weight.

(018:10)CG:	Okay.

(018:11)CHW:	Okay, but if that, if she doesn’t lose the 3% of her body weight, she’ll either go into what’s called additional skills, where she get more lessons about weight management or she will go into what’s called contingency management and with that she’ll be able to earn points that she can purchase things on Amazon with if she loses weight.

(018:37)CG:	Mm-hmm.  Okay.

(018:39)CHW:	Okay?  But for the first three months it’s mainly lessons, okay?  And there will be some assignments that she’ll have to do and some things that you’ll have to do that’ll come a little bit later, not this week or in a few weeks, okay?

(019:00)CG:	Okay.

(019:03)CHW:	And are you ready to get started?

(019:06)CG:	I mean I don’t care.

(019:07)CHW:	{0:19:07} =

(019:09)CG:	It don’t matter.

(019:11)CHW:	Okay.  So, oh, and I’m sorry.  I forgot to tell you.

(019:13)CG:	{0:19:13}

(019:15)CHW:	Yeah, everything is confidential, so nothing, you know, is, the recordings won’t be used for anything other than what you signed a consent form for.

(019:27)CG:	Okay.

(019:28)CHW:	For those, okay.  Any questions?

(019:29)CG:	No.

(019:31)CHW:	Okay.  If you could fill one out and while you’re doing that, I’m going to, what I’d like to do is get our next session scheduled with the nutritionist.

(019:52)CG:	Okay.  

(019:56)CHW:	And here you go, here’s a pen if you need it, so I’m going to text her and see, ‘cause I got an e-mail from her earlier that, but I wanted to make sure she’s still available for those times.

(020:12) [pause]

(020:28)CHW:	Baker College, you go there?

(020:30)CG:	I used to.  It was too fast for me.

(020:33)CHW:	It, was it? [laughs]

(020:35)CG:	I felt a little slow.  I was like, “Y’all moving too fast.”

(020:38)CHW:	Oh, okay. [laughs] I thought about going there, but they were really, really pricey.  Wsssh.

(020:46)CG:	Yeah.

(021:02)CHW:	I put it on the side {0:21:03}.  Okay, you have a seat.  I’m getting ready to…soon as I find my phone in this purse.  Get in touch with the nutritionist so that we can get you scheduled so that you can start learning about … food part of the program.  That’s the problem with big bags.

(021:45)CG:	You can call your phone, make it ring.

(024:29)PT:	Mm-hmm.

(027:41)CHW:	Okay, so now can I share yours with her?

(027:44)CG:	Mm-hmm.

(027:45)CHW:	Okay.  Mom wants to, is going to support you.  I’m going to get you the proper food in the house to eat and the reason she wants to do this because this is something you said she wants, you wanted to do and she’s going to support you.  And she’s going to support you by following the steps in the program, so our first step is going to be next week you’re going to learn about healthy eating with Jenny, our dietician.  Okay?  And if you have questions about eating healthy you can make a list and yeah, write them down and things like that, you too.  She’s a dietician, ‘cause I know you said you had diabetes, so if you have questions she’d be able to answer those for you, too.

(027:45)PT:	Okay.

(027:46)CHW:	Okay?  And so we’ve got that appointment scheduled and then you said Friday was good also?

(028:42)CG:	Mm-hmm.

(029:15)PT:	He don’t like me.

(029:18)CG:	They aggravate each other.

(029:20)CHW:	Hey, that’s always the way it goes when you have brothers and sisters.  You love them, but they aggravate you and get on your nerves at the same time.

(029:32)PT:	Oww.

(029:36)CHW:	So both of you {0:29:38}.  Okay, your mom’s going to help and you think you want to run each day?  Okay, you won’t get out of breath?  Your asthma will be okay?

(029:57)CG:	There’s one upstairs.  I have several.

(029:58)CHW:	Okay.  And working together we'll get you back into your clothes, okay?  And now I’m not going to say it’s easy, because losing weight is work.  It is not the easiest thing in the world, but if you really work at it, you try really hard and do the things that you learn about, you’ll be able to.  What do you think?

(030:32)PT:	Yeah.

(030:33)CHW:	Okay.  It’s about, you know, making new habits and breaking old ones, and getting used to doing some things different than what you been doing.  And how does that sound to you?

(030:45)PT:	Good.

(030:46)CHW:	Okay.  Great.  And so we’re scheduled for next week.  Now you’ve got my number?

Just let me know, okay?  

(031:18)CG:	Mm-hmm.

(031:19)CHW:	If you have an emergency I cannot give medical advice.  Call the doctor, okay?  And but we’ll meet, we will meet the twice a week.  Okay?

(031:35)PT:	Okay.

(031:36)CHW:	Okay, now the only other thing I need to do is get your weight and I’ll be taking your weight once a week, okay?  And it’ll help us see what- if the things that we’re doing, if those changes that we’re making, if they’re working, because you know, certain things work for some people and they don’t work for other people, so the things that work for you, we’ll keep those things and the things that don’t work, we’ll toss them out and start new with something else.  How does that sound?

(032:10)PT:	Good.

(032:11)CHW:	Okay?  And so, but once a week I’ll get your weight and if something happens, like say you gain weight.  Nobody’s going to get mad at you, ‘cause getting mad at you is not going to make you lose any weight or anything like that, but we will be working on trying to figure out what things happened that week to cause you to gain weight.  Okay?  And if you lose weight that week, we’ll try to figure out what helped you lose weight so we can take that over to the next week so that you can be successful then.  How does that sound?

(032:50)PT:	Good.

(032:50)CHW:	That sounds good?  Okay.  So we’ll get your weight and then I will be out of here.  Okay?  I left my scale in the car.  I guess this getting lost sort of flustered me. [laughs] You know?

(033:06)CG:	You should’ve just called me.

(033:07)CHW:	Well, I thought I was going the right way and I wind up back in Detroit.  I’m like, “What?!”

(033:15)CG:	Where was you at?

(033:18) [crosstalk]

(034:18)CHW:	So we’re scheduled for the two appointments and can, you want to come to the car and I can weigh you?

(034:24)PT:	Mm-hmm.

(034:25)CHW:	Okay.  Okay.  And ‘cause that’s our last step.  I’ll be much more together next time, I promise. [laughs]

(034:36)CG:	You’re fine.
