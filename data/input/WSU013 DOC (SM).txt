00:00:24.9	HCP1	Okay, so any other drugs?
00:00:27.2	PT	No.
00:00:27.8	HCP1	Any pills, powder, IV? Nothing?
00:00:31.3	PT	Nope.
00:00:32.2	HCP1	Perfect. Okay. So, moving on. Um, how about relationships?
00:00:39.9	PT	Um, I'm with someone, uh, I've been talking to since November. Um, he is aware of my status. Um, we're protected. Um, yep, just him.
00:00:53.3	HCP1	Okay. So for preference, male, female, both – you said?
00:00:55.7	PT	Male.
00:00:55.9	HCP1	Okay. And um, so you said protected sex, but um, do you use condoms with every intercourse?
00:01:03.9	PT	Yeah, orally and anal.
00:01:07.6	HCP1	Okay. And you said he's aware of the situation and he knows?
00:01:10.7	PT	Mm-hmm.
00:01:11.0	HCP1	Okay. And um, I see that you tested positive in November and you received treatment for it.
00:01:18.2	PT	Mm-hmm, yeah.
00:01:18.8	HCP1	Okay. Any other, um, you know, screening for any infections after that?
00:01:23.8	PT	No, no.
00:01:25.2	HCP1	Okay. And you completed the treatment at that time?
00:01:28.8	PT	Mm-hmm.
00:01:28.9	HCP1	Perfect. Okay, any other partners within that period of time, since we last saw you?
00:01:36.1	PT	Mm-mm.
00:01:38.8	HCP1	Okay.
00:01:49.5	PT	Nope. In school.
00:01:50.8	HCP1	Oh, you're in school too?
00:01:51.7	PT	Yeah.
00:01:51.7	HCP1	Oh, what are you studying?
00:01:52.7	PT	Mortuary science.
00:02:00.3	HCP1	How long have you been doing that?
00:02:01.7	PT	Um, started fully going for it, um, I would say last year. Um, I had been taking classes, um, but really taking four, five, six classes – might as well.
00:02:16.4	HCP1	[00:02:16.4].
00:02:17.9	PT	Um, well I'm studying at Wayne County now, so this fall I'll be transferring over there to Wayne State. Another two years and I'll be done. You want me to sit here?
00:02:32.7	HCP1	And [in the meantime], I think kind of review of your general health, top to toes. Any headaches that you've been experiencing? You initially said no, but anything new?
00:02:43.9	PT	No.
00:02:44.8	HCP1	Any change in your vision? Change in hearing? Okay, any runny nose? Congestion? Cough? Sore throat?
00:02:54.2	PT	Nope.
00:02:54.6	HCP1	Difficulty with swallowing? Pain with swallowing?
00:02:56.6	PT	Mm-mm.
00:02:57.6	HCP1	Nothing? Perfect. How about any abdominal pain – you know, like stomach aches?
00:03:01.3	PT	No.
00:03:02.1	HCP1	Okay. Um, for your bowel movements, um, do you have any – have you noticed any change in your bowel movements – increase, decrease in frequency, change in consistency – anything like that?
00:03:14.7	PT	Mm-mm. Everything is normal.
00:03:16.3	HCP1	Perfect. Any numbness? Tingling? Okay. Any, like, frequent falls or accidents that you weren't experiencing before – anything like that?
00:03:27.2	PT	No.
00:03:28.1	HCP1	Wonderful. Everything sounds great. I'm just a little sick myself, so just to make sure that you don't catch anything from me, um, I will have my mask when I'm kind of, like, listening and examining your mouth and all, but... That virus has been going around everything. It's almost been impossible not to avoid [sic], you know, that cold.
00:03:49.2	PT	Yeah, especially [in the Carlson], we don't have assigned seating, so when we come in it's – I be Lysoling. I'm like, how you doing? Because it's something like when I get sick and it's just a little cold, it feels like I need to go to the hospital because there's something wrong – but they were like, you're just sick. I'm like, ugh, I hate it.
00:04:09.3	HCP1	And like, it always come over the weekend, you know? You have some time off, and then you start coughing and runny nose, and I'm like, ugh. Okay, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs first, okay?
00:04:20.5	PT	Mm-hmm.
00:04:38.9	HCP1	Deep breath. Perfect. One more. One more deep breath. Wonderful. If you can put your head down for me, I'll get the foot rest. I need to listen to your [00:05:18.8] first. Are you living with family, or, um, by yourself?
00:05:42.3	PT	Uh, by myself at the moment.
00:05:44.3	HCP1	Oh, okay. Have you noticed any change in your weight recently?
00:06:02.8	PT	Mm-mm.
00:06:03.4	HCP1	Okay. I'm going to check the lymph nodes, okay?
00:06:09.0	PT	Mm-hmm.
00:06:16.1	HCP1	You can sit up. Thank you. I'm feeling the lymph nodes under the arm. Okay.
00:07:01.0	PT	So, you're out of Beaumont?
00:07:02.3	HCP1	Yeah.
00:07:03.5	PT	Oh.
00:07:03.8	HCP1	I'm just doing a rotation this month here. Normally I work out Beaumont.
00:07:09.1	PT	Now, how do they place you all at the hospital? Like, how did you get it at Beaumont? Is it the school, or...?
00:07:16.4	HCP1	So, for our application, we go through a match process, so every year, um, at the same time, like in July, um, they will accept applications through a central system. So we put in our application. We say we want to do, like – I said I wanted to, um, children's, like a pediatric, and I applied. Thank you. [Laughs] So, I see some whiteness around your tongue. Has it always been like that?
00:07:45.5	PT	No.
00:07:45.5	HCP1	Have you noticed any change?
00:07:47.0	PT	No.
00:07:48.8	HCP1	Okay. What I'm going to do is I'm going to try squeezing it, because sometimes when I'm dehydrated or something – 
00:07:54.7	PT	Probably that.
00:07:55.1	HCP1	– you have that.
00:07:56.7	PT	Because my mouth is dry. [Laughs]
00:07:57.6	HCP1	Okay.
00:07:58.9	PT	And I did brush my teeth, but that was about it. I didn't have anything...
00:08:06.8	HCP1	I can't see any tongue depressors. Oh, there we go. Okay. So yeah, and then, uh, once we apply, we send our scores and, you know, background information kind of thing – like our medical-school scores and how we did. And then they call us for interviews. I'm sorry, but... Okay, I don't see any redness underneath, which is reassuring for me. Okay. And you said no pain with swallowing, no pain when you're eating something, right?
00:08:40.9	PT	Nope.
00:08:42.2	HCP1	Nope? Okay, sounds good.
00:08:44.9	PT	[Lately I had a dentist appointment]. I feel like I [had these wisdom] – because that's the only thing that is, as far as that look. They got to – they got to take them out.
00:08:52.9	HCP1	Oh, okay. So you scheduled your appointment, you said?
00:08:54.1	PT	Yeah, I'm going to call today.
00:08:55.9	HCP1	Okay. Okay.
00:08:57.9	PT	But that's it.
00:08:59.7	HCP1	Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much.
00:09:01.8	PT	Thank you.
00:09:01.9	HCP1	It was really nice to meet you. Um, we'll go back and talk to Dr. Sekor and, um, we'll see Deb and let them know about how you're doing, and we'll go through our plan with them and come back and let you know in a couple minutes, okay?
00:09:14.6	PT	Okay, okay.
00:09:15.0	HCP1	Anything that you wanted to – 
00:09:17.4	HCP2	No, I think that we're good, yeah.
00:09:18.5	HCP1	Okay.
00:09:20.0	PT	So nice. [Laughter]
00:09:20.1	HCP1	Yeah.
00:09:22.0	PT	Thank you.
00:09:22.5	HCP1	Yeah, we'll come back in a couple minutes.
00:09:24.3	PT	Okay.
		00:09:26.7 – 00:23:05.8 BREAK IN CLINICAL INTERACTION
00:23:06.3	PT	Hi.
00:23:06.7	HCP3	How you doing?
00:23:07.7	PT	I'm great. How are you?
00:23:09.3	HCP3	So, you know, we're trying to figure out – um, your viral load has gone down, but it's not – it won't go down all the way.
00:23:15.7	PT	Okay.
00:23:16.5	HCP3	So we looked back, and we looked at the resistance that you have, and you have a little bit of resistance. I think we had talked about it once before, because we sent – um, we sent some other labs to see if we could change your meds. Um, to make a long story short, one of the labs that we sent they couldn't do because your viral load wasn't high enough, so we're sending it again.
00:23:38.5	PT	Okay.
00:23:39.3	HCP3	The other, um – you know, the one that you had resistance to that – which is called Emtriva, or 3TC – lamivudine – is part of the Truvada, so we're going to switch your meds a little bit until we get back this other test.
00:23:53.9	PT	Okay.
00:23:55.1	HCP3	The other test is going to tell us if you're eligible to take less pills.
00:23:59.4	PT	Okay.
00:23:59.8	HCP3	You know, there's a newer med. So we think – you know, we want – really want to get your virals all the way down, you know, to keep you healthy.
00:24:06.0	PT	Okay.
00:24:06.5	HCP3	So, the four meds you're going to take – I'll just write it out. It's, you know – you're still, um – it was the darunavir, right? Or Prezista. I think you probably now it as Prezista. And then you're taking Norvir with that. So this one actually is used to boost the Prezista – give it a big [P]. And um, then the other one you were on is Truvada.
00:24:34.0	PT	Truvada.
00:24:34.3	HCP3	Instead of Truvada, you'll take Tenofovir, which is – was part of the Truvada.
00:24:40.0	PT	Truvada.
00:24:40.3	HCP3	And then we're replacing that other half of the Truvada with, um, Abacavir. Um, actually we gave it in a combined tablet called Epzicom so that you only have to take one pill.
00:24:52.5	PT	Okay.
00:24:53.0	HCP3	Okay?
00:24:53.8	PT	Mm-hmm.
00:24:54.3	HCP3	So, it just – we tried to keep it as simple as possible. If we gave you just the Abacavir, you'd have to take it twice a day, you know? It would be a mess. So this is easier, but it's four pills instead of three until we get back the test, and then maybe we can get it down to two.
00:25:09.8	PT	So, as of today, start taking the – 
00:25:12.3	HCP3	Well...
00:25:12.8	PT	Well, whenever it comes.
00:25:14.5	HCP3	Yeah, you have to wait for Mark to deliver.
00:25:16.2	PT	Okay, but in the meantime still take the Truvada?
00:25:18.5	HCP3	Right, take what you have, because that still has the Tenofovir that you need in it, okay?
00:25:22.4	PT	Okay.
00:25:22.8	HCP3	But your viral load is going down, it just won't – 
00:25:26.1	PT	Yeah, okay.
00:25:26.8	HCP3	So... Now, um, I heard, like, no unprotected sex.
00:25:31.1	PT	No, no.
00:25:31.6	HCP3	So you're not worried about having picked anything up.
00:25:33.4	PT	Nope.
00:25:33.9	HCP3	And um, you haven't been to the ER or the hospital.
00:25:38.2	PT	No.
00:25:38.6	HCP3	So let me take a quick look at you. Anything that you're concerned about? No?
00:25:44.9	PT	I'm eager to learn the results – the next results.
00:25:48.8	HCP3	Yeah, we'd like to get the pills down to less. That would be nice.
00:25:52.7	PT	So, that would be it.
00:25:52.8	HCP3	A lot of people are resistant to that one medication – the 3TC. It's easy to get resistant to. And like old school, we keep the medication so, uh – because keeping it on keeps you from getting resistant to other things. It's the old way. Some people don't believe that anymore, but it doesn't hurt to take it.
00:26:10.0	PT	Okay.
00:26:10.8	HCP3	Um, you still working at the call center?
00:26:15.2	PT	Mm-hmm.
00:26:15.6	HCP3	Okay. Um, are you back in school, or no?
00:26:19.0	PT	I'm still in school, yeah.
00:26:20.0	HCP3	You're still in school?
00:26:20.0	PT	Mm-hmm.
00:26:20.7	HCP3	What are you taking now?
00:26:22.1	PT	Um, now I'm taking Biology 250.
00:26:25.1	HCP3	All right, all right. Good for you.
00:26:27.6	PT	Um, and two English classes and a math.
00:26:29.7	HCP3	Whoa, what English classes?
00:26:30.9	PT	English 119 and English 115.
00:26:35.5	HCP3	Do you like it?
00:26:36.6	PT	The 115, yes. The 119 is – 
00:26:39.2	HCP3	What's the matter with the other, with the 119?
00:26:40.6	PT	There's a lot of writing?
00:26:41.3	HCP3	Yeah?
00:26:41.5	PT	Lot of writing.
00:26:43.2	HCP3	And do you usually like to write?
00:26:44.3	PT	No.
00:26:44.7	HCP3	No?
00:26:45.9	PT	Well, I'm doing it, so I'm learning how to get in the environment where I can write, so...
00:26:52.5	HCP3	Yeah? So that's a lot of classes. Do you work full time?
00:26:55.9	PT	Yeah, but it's – it's a lot of downtime.
00:27:00.0	HCP3	Okay, so you can study and stuff during downtime?
00:27:00.0	PT	And then when I'm sitting at the computer – so, yeah.
00:27:01.9	HCP3	That's great. That's great.
00:27:03.4	PT	So yeah. Then a lot of my – um, both my English classes are online, so when I'm down I can be on there.
00:27:08.7	HCP3	Oh, cool, cool. So you do this online. How long does it take you to finish a course?
00:27:15.0	PT	Uh, a course is running from like January to May.
00:27:18.4	HCP3	Okay, so you have to finish it in that timeframe.
00:27:20.0	PT	Yes.
00:27:20.0	HCP3	It's not, like, open-ended.
00:27:21.4	PT	Yeah.
00:27:21.9	HCP3	Okay. Well, cool, cool. All right. Everything's online. [Laughter]. I'm looking for – I want to look in your ears. I'm just looking for the ear... There's one. Found it.
00:27:40.0	HCP1	Here is a bigger one.
00:27:42.6	HCP3	That's okay. I think I got one that'll fit on here. Let's see. Looks fine. And anything else that's bothering you?
00:27:53.5	PT	No.
00:27:53.9	HCP3	So the medications – um, any side effects or problems from them? No?
00:27:58.8	PT	No, not that I can – no.
00:28:00.3	HCP3	Excellent. Because you'd noticed if you – 
00:28:02.9	PT	Yeah, yeah.
00:28:03.3	HCP3	Let's see the back of your throat. So the sort of things you wouldn't notice, we monitor for. You have like a coating on your tongue – 
00:28:11.8	PT	Yeah.
00:28:12.2	HCP3	– maybe from... Do you have any allergies, or...?
00:28:13.9	PT	No, my mouth was just dry. I haven't had nothing to drink, yeah.
00:28:17.5	HCP3	Yeah? So this probably is just, you know, the season. I'm going to have you sit down back here. I love your shirt.
00:28:24.4	PT	[Laughs] Thank you.
00:28:25.2	HCP3	Cute, cute. Deep breath. If you'd lie back, I'd just like to check your liver and your spleen as long as you're here. So do you work the night shift, or what?
00:28:53.2	PT	Uh, I actually start on Monday. I will be days pretty much, but I'm – it's still days. I work – now it's 12:00 to 9:00, and then, um, starting Monday I'll be 8:00 to 4:00. So then – then I – 
00:29:06.8	HCP3	Do you prefer that?
00:29:08.4	PT	8:00 to 4:00? Uh, yeah. So then I can still get off and do other things, and then there has to be time for the summer if I'm still there.
00:29:16.1	HCP3	Yeah?
00:29:16.3	PT	Then I have a – like I was telling them, I was going for, um, [Maritime Petroleum]. They have, uh, a job opening. I go for my testing.
00:29:24.7	HCP3	What would you do there?
00:29:25.4	PT	It's something with refinery. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but they said they train – they're training for it – and I filled it out and am doing my tests on the second.
00:29:37.0	HCP3	Cool, cool. So, we'll keep our fingers crossed for you.
00:29:39.6	PT	Yes. $25 an hour. I need it. [Laughs].
00:29:42.7	HCP3	Yeah, so as long as you like it; that's what matters – and they pay you well.
00:29:46.6	PT	I hope so.
00:29:48.4	HCP3	Um, so you don't smoke cigarettes. You do still smoke pot, but do you smoke about the same as you used to, more, or less?
00:29:57.5	PT	A little less.
00:29:58.5	HCP3	A little less?
00:29:58.5	PT	A little less.
00:29:58.6	HCP3	Okay. Good. Good for you. As you get older, cutting back a bit is a good idea. Do you ever feel that it interferes with things that you want to do?
00:30:07.1	PT	No.
00:30:08.0	HCP3	No?
00:30:08.0	PT	Not really, no.
00:30:08.5	HCP3	Okay. And um, you drink, um, alcohol a few times a month?
00:30:16.1	PT	Just – yeah, most of it, like I was telling them, is wine, but other than that, no.
00:30:21.3	HCP3	And is that by yourself, or with your friends?
00:30:23.4	PT	With my friends.
00:30:24.1	HCP3	With your friends? What about when you're smoking the pot. Is that by yourself or with your friends?
00:30:27.2	PT	Friends.
00:30:27.4	HCP3	Friends? Okay. We always ask because, you know, we worry a bit less if it's social, as long as it's not, you know, like, constant.
00:30:35.8	PT	Yeah, yeah.
00:30:37.4	HCP3	But just to, you know, remember that marijuana impairs you like alcohol does, so just to... People sometimes forget just to be careful. Um, I don't think there's anything else. You've been doing well. We're happy with your numbers, except the viral load – 
00:30:52.5	PT	Viral load.
00:30:52.8	HCP3	– isn't as low as we'd like to push it, so we just want to push that the rest of the way down.
00:30:57.0	PT	Okay.
00:30:57.9	HCP3	You know, because we're fussy.
00:30:59.7	PT	I like it. [Laughter].
00:31:00.5	HCP3	Yeah, the lower we keep it, the better your T-cells stay through life. So I'd like you back in a month, okay?
00:31:05.4	PT	Okay.
00:31:06.2	HCP3	So that we can recheck the new meds. Um, we're going to call MedCard and make sure that they deliver ASAP and deliver the right stuff. Any problem, give me a call, okay?
00:31:14.8	PT	Okay.
00:31:15.6	HCP3	You know how to text me or reach me or – you know.
00:31:22.9	PT	And what is that?
00:31:24.4	HCP3	It's, uh, 313-461-5245. Now remember, text me, don't call.
00:31:31.1	PT	Texting.
00:31:31.4	HCP3	Because if I get a number that I don't recognize, I won't always answer because I don't know who that is.
00:31:36.4	PT	Yeah.
00:31:36.8	HCP3	And then when you text, tell me who you are so I don't have to say, huh?
00:31:40.8	PT	Yeah. [Laughs]
00:31:42.1	HCP3	Who's this? So just – you know?
00:31:43.5	PT	Yeah.
00:31:43.8	HCP3	And then I'll get right back to you, okay?
00:31:45.1	PT	Great, thank you.
00:31:46.7	HCP3	Okay, take it easy.
00:31:46.9	PT	I will.
00:31:47.9	HCP3	And uh, here's your stuff for the lab.
00:31:49.6	PT	Okay.
00:31:50.1	HCP3	Okay, you're good.
00:31:51.4	PT	Thank you.
00:31:52.3	HCP3	So come on, we'll walk you up to the front and get you an appointment.
00:31:56.5	PT	She's really nice. I like her.
00:31:57.7	HCP3	I know. We like her to keep coming back.
00:32:00.6	PT	When you retire, I might be able to find her. [Laughter]
00:32:03.2	HCP3	Yeah, that's good, you know? We're going to have to go find her to, like, keep training here and stay.
00:32:10.5	HCP1	[Laughs] Thank you.
00:32:13.8	HCP3	And I'm supposed to sign in. Okay.
