00:00:02.6	PT	– in your mouth with this lotion and stuff. I didn't want that one.
00:00:06.2	HCP1	Well, I have the ChapStick, but I didn't know they – wow. All right. So how are you?
00:00:10.6	PT	I'm fine. I'm great.
00:00:12.0	HCP1	Where have you been? You knew I would ask.
00:00:15.9	PT	I've been everywhere. Just really been working a lot from one to the end. The dancing has been happening everywhere. We're finally getting noticed.
00:00:25.6	HCP1	Congrats. Now where are you working?
00:00:28.1	PT	Um, right now I work at [Couple Hall], and I still work at, um – um, I'm working at – as a home-care giver.
00:00:36.2	HCP1	Okay, nice.
00:00:36.4	PT	I do that as well. 
00:00:38.8	HCP1	Okay, who are you – like, for who?
00:00:40.2	PT	Um, for my grandma. She – I'm like her – like one of them – I don't know how you say like a home-aid person where they pay you, like you're just her in-home nurse or something.
00:00:49.9	HCP1	Okay, so what do you do?
00:00:51.2	PT	I just help her. Like, I wash her up. She gets in the tub. I feed her, bake her food. I make sure I'm all clean, and I take her to her appointments and things like that.
00:00:59.3	HCP1	Okay, got it. So, last time you were here we – you have not seen me since July.
00:01:05.3	PT	July? No, I came here before [sic] July. It was – the last time I came was July?
00:01:12.4	HCP1	Yeah, and you were positive for gonorrhea and we treated you on that July visit.
00:01:17.5	PT	Oh yes, that's what that was. I did not know that was July. That was a very long time. I'm sorry, I'm really messing up these – this time. I just be so busy. I really am sorry for that.
00:01:28.1	HCP1	So this is it. It's your health, right? It's your health. You've got to prioritize your health.
00:01:34.6	PT	Yes.
00:01:34.8	HCP1	Right? Because if you get sick, then you can't dance and you can't work. So then these things that are keeping you busy are going to be gone, right?
00:01:46.1	PT	Yes.
00:01:49.6	HCP1	So, uh, the last time you were here you were undetectable, which is good, so congratulations, and your – 
00:01:56.1	PT	What does that mean?
00:01:56.4	HCP1	Your viral load was – it – your viral load was less than 20.
00:02:01.3	PT	Wow.
00:02:01.3	HCP1	So, the goal is – you're – 
00:02:04.1	PT	I did not know that. [Laughs]
00:02:05.4	HCP1	Yeah. Last time you were undetectable. So what that means to me is that you're taking your meds.
00:02:09.6	PT	Mm-hmm. See, that's the issue. That's why I'm here, because I stopped – like, I stopped receiving them, and like – and I've been trying to get in contact. I told – I talked to Irv, but when I tried to contact you guys – I don't know why I did that. I contacted you while it was almost close to the holiday, and I left voice messages at your office, but they said you have plenty of offices, so – so it was something. I don't know what was wrong, but I was trying to get in contact with y'all before Christmas – like the week before Christmas, and they said y'all was on vacation.
00:02:34.9	HCP1	Who did you talk to?
00:02:36.4	PT	Um, I talked to Irving. Before I talked to him, it was some other lady. They said that y'all were on vacation and y'all weren't going to be back until the New Year's, so then I'd have to call again after that.
00:02:45.1	HCP1	Did you say that you didn't have meds?
00:02:46.3	PT	Yeah, I told them, but then that's when I talked to Irv in the New Year. Like, I talked to him I think on the 5th, and he said that, um, he will call the MedCard people and see what was going on – why they didn't – why they stopped sending me – because he said I was supposed to receive six bags, and I only received four – and I told him, yeah, it was only for those last four. I guess, like, I thought y'all would be back for the last four months of the year, because I didn't get six. I got four, and he said I was supposed to get six.
00:03:08.6	HCP1	We do six refills.
00:03:10.3	PT	Yeah, I didn't get six of them. I only got four.
00:03:12.8	HCP1	Okay.
00:03:14.4	PT	That's what I – that's why I didn't know what was going on, because that normally doesn't happen. When y'all did it the last time, y'all gave me six, and then this time it was only four.
00:03:22.3	HCP1	So when was the last time you took your meds?
00:03:24.4	PT	Uh, I would say it would almost be a month. Like, it would be like three – maybe three weeks, yeah.
00:03:30.5	HCP1	Um, what are you taking?
00:03:33.0	PT	Um, the three – the Truvada, [00:03:36.3]. I don't know how to say them all. They're really weird.
00:03:37.7	HCP1	Truvada, [00:03:38.7]?
00:03:38.7	PT	Yes. They're some really weird names.
00:03:41.4	HCP1	Okay, so outside of when you have been off the past month, any other missed doses?
00:03:46.8	PT	Um, no. I normally just take my medicine every day like you guys tell me too. It's just...
00:03:53.4	HCP1	So, I'm going to give you my number too, because you – if you call me and say, hey, I don't have any meds, we're going to get it figured out, because the problem with you being off meds like this is it puts you at risk for what?
00:04:07.1	PT	For other things, right?
00:04:09.4	HCP1	What? What are other things?
00:04:13.2	PT	Would it, like – well, I don't know if after I stop taking my meds – I started to itch a lot again. I know that.
00:04:18.3	HCP1	Possibly that, but what else? What happens when you're not on your HIV meds and then you go back on?
00:04:22.4	PT	My HIV viral load will go back up high, right?
00:04:23.7	HCP1	Mm-hmm, and what else?
00:04:27.5	PT	Can't it get worse?
00:04:29.3	HCP1	But how? What do I mean?
00:04:32.9	PT	I don't know.
00:04:33.2	HCP1	[00:04:33.3], where the med doesn't work. Your body can become resistant to the medication, where it doesn't work.
00:04:40.6	PT	Okay.
00:04:43.3	HCP1	So, I mean, we're going to – we'll restart you back on it today. I want you to come back in two weeks. Um, well, I'll call – we'll call and figure out what was wrong – why you didn't get the meds. Did you call MedCard yourself?
00:04:55.3	PT	Um, I don't have a MedCard. I don't know.
00:04:57.2	HCP1	Is it on the bottle?
00:04:59.1	PT	I don't know.
00:04:59.5	HCP1	It's on the bottle. Do you have your meds with you?
00:05:01.2	PT	No, I don't have them with me. I haven't had any in a long time.
00:05:05.2	HCP1	Just heads up, a lot of times on the bottle it'll say what the pharmacy is and what the numbers are. Um, so next time call. You call MedCard and be like, what's going on? Why don't I have my meds? Because sometimes, too, if an address changes or a number changes, they can't get a hold with you. I think every month they have to verify your – kind of where you're at before they resend them out.
00:05:27.6	PT	Yes, I'm at – I've been at the same address. It's the same one.
00:05:30.4	HCP1	Okay, then I don't know. Um, but I'm going to give you my number.
00:05:32.9	PT	Yeah, I'm ready.
00:05:33.5	HCP1	Uh, 313-745-4454.
00:05:41.0	PT	Okay.
00:05:41.0	HCP1	All right, so next time just give me a call, and I – we can get it figured out, okay? All right, so, any – in general, just any health concerns? Anything you want to discuss?
00:05:54.4	PT	Um, I was just – I – just coming from my regular appointment, and then – um, to tell you guys that I haven't been on the medicine in like three weeks – and then, like, after the medicine, it's just me not taking it. My body be so itchy now.
00:06:08.4	HCP1	Okay, where are you itchy?
00:06:09.8	PT	Like, I itch, like, normally, like, on my arms or on my legs, and then, like, um – oh yes, like, when I stopped taking the medicine, it was like – I don't know if it was like a mark or something, but it's like a mark that's disappearing on the top of my head penis again – but it's not like what it was the first time. It's just like a mark. It looks like it's in my skin, but it's not. I don't know. It do look different from what – I've never seen it before.
00:06:37.0	HCP1	How long has that been there?
00:06:37.6	PT	Um, like – I would say like two weeks.
00:06:40.1	HCP1	Okay. Does it itch or anything?
00:06:41.5	PT	No, it doesn't itch. Like, I just be – I don't know. It just my – like, all this inner be itching, and then my sidearms – like, that's what really be itching now, and it's weird. Like, just this and my arms.
00:06:54.3	HCP1	So, I have a question. Does it happen more during certain times of the year, or has this never happened before?
00:06:58.0	PT	Like, it only happens around this year. Like, I – it probably might just be my eczema. I don't know, because it normally happens around the wintertime with this dusty air.
00:07:06.3	HCP1	It could be the dry skin, and it shifts.
00:07:08.4	PT	Yeah.
00:07:08.5	HCP1	Do you use, like, special lotion?
00:07:10.3	PT	Yeah, I use, like, um, cocoa butter. I use cocoa butter lotion, and I use Dove lotion, because that's – well, my doctor said, before I started coming to you guys – that's what I was recommended to use, because all the other soaps and stuff would make my skin peel and everything, and it was really nasty.
00:07:25.8	HCP1	Okay. No, I was going to say keep doing that [00:07:26.6] seal it in some Vaseline, so just kind of put that all over. We already talked about meds. You're living with your mom, right? 
00:07:26.6	PT	Yes.
00:07:36.2	HCP1	Um, and then you're working at [Cogo] Hall, and you're also working at the Home and Health Aid, and you're dancing. Oh, you're 18.
00:07:54.8	PT	No, I'm 19. I'm going to be 20 this year.
00:07:57.5	HCP1	Are you dancing through school?
00:07:59.0	PT	No, it's the regular program, like – they're just an international traveling dance team – just regular like that.
00:08:06.2	HCP1	Got it. Do you like it?
00:08:07.1	PT	It's really fun. Like, it's really fun. Now we even got to the point where we're really going to be on the next season of "Bring It" with Diana. It's really coming together, and we're fixing to get ready to have our own studio in another couple of months.
00:08:19.5	HCP1	Okay. Now, what type of dance is it?
00:08:20.7	PT	It's like all – it's like a mixture of modern and jazz, hip hop. And then they also do the [Jay said] – like, have you ever seen what the college girls do?
00:08:28.2	HCP1	Yeah?
00:08:28.4	PT	That one, yeah.
00:08:29.5	HCP1	Well, I looked it up on YouTube.
00:08:32.7	PT	Yes, that's like a really new style now that's really trending, and we do that one as well. Like, we just won a competition for that for like $3,500. Came in first place, and we got to be on Diana's show. That's what we're doing now.
00:08:43.9	HCP1	Congratulations.
00:08:44.4	PT	Thank you.
00:08:47.6	HCP1	Just remind me, do you drink alcohol?
00:08:49.0	PT	Um, the last time I – actually yes, I went out to the club, like, I think a week ago, and I had one cup. Yes, I did.
00:08:56.2	HCP1	At the club?
00:08:56.2	PT	Yeah.
00:08:57.7	HCP1	How? You're 19.
00:08:59.3	PT	Yeah. Uh, the clubs in Detroit are 18 and older.
00:09:02.7	HCP1	Yeah, but you still can't drink.
00:09:04.3	PT	Yeah, you can't drink, but I guess – you know how when you in a club, people buy liquor for you and stuff like that. Like me, personally, every time I'm in the club, people always want to come and see me, ask me, do they want to buy me this? Do they want to buy me that? So, it just be like that.
00:09:16.6	HCP1	Okay. Um, so on average about how often do you drink?
00:09:19.2	PT	I wouldn't say I don't drink often. I only drink when I go out, and I really go out.
00:09:23.0	HCP1	Like once a month?
00:09:24.1	PT	I wouldn't say that. I would probably say, like – you could probably say like once every three to four months. I really don't go out like that. Like, I really hate the clubs. The Detroit clubs? They are really just too much for me. The only reason I went out was because it was my friend's birthday, and he really wanted me to come. So I did.
00:09:38.1	HCP1	What do you mean by too much? I've not been.
00:09:39.9	PT	Like, they just – the gay world in Detroit – it's really too much. Like, they just be – all they want to do is fight and argue over who's sleeping with somebody's man and all of this. It just be too much drama. Like, I feel like it's not safe to go to the clubs no more because you're wasting your money. You're paying $15 to get in.
00:09:55.8	HCP1	$15?
00:09:56.4	PT	Yes. Like, you've got to pay that much. Then you get put out because somebody in the club fighting, and y’all want to shut the whole club down. Like, I just be feeling like I be wasting my money. There's no point in me going if I'm going to keep getting put out because of ignorant people.
00:10:10.2	HCP1	Right. All right, any tobacco use? Any cigarettes?
00:10:13.7	PT	Um, I smoked a jazz whatsit from here and there.
00:10:18.0	HCP1	Wait, a cigarette?
00:10:18.3	PT	No, a jazz – it's call a jazz whatsit.
00:10:20.2	HCP1	What's that?
00:10:21.5	PT	It's – I don't know. It's like a black, but it's just a name for it, I guess.
00:10:24.5	HCP1	Like a little cigar?
00:10:25.8	PT	Yeah.
00:10:26.7	HCP1	About how often are you smoking?
00:10:27.8	PT	Well, I only do that when I go to the club. Like, that's the same thing as the drinking. I only do that to keep the liquor down.
00:10:33.9	HCP1	Okay, I wouldn't... You're dancing.
00:10:37.1	PT	Yes. [Laughs]
00:10:37.1	HCP1	Okay? Any drug use? Marijuana? Cocaine?
00:10:39.4	PT	No.
00:10:39.8	HCP1	Okay. And then since you were last here, any sexual activity?
00:10:42.1	PT	No.
00:10:43.2	HCP1	No? Nothing?
00:10:43.7	PT	Mm-mm.
00:10:44.7	HCP1	No sexual – 
00:10:46.0	PT	I haven't had time. I've been so busy, it's just everything – the dancing, the working. I don't even have time to have... My mama keeps saying – she like, "I just feel like you just trying to put your life on hold now and you act like you don't want to have a boyfriend." I'm like, "It's not that. I just feel like I just don't want to do it no more. I'm just over it. Like, I just really want to live my life. I'm young. When I get older – I feel it's best for me to just wait until I get older, so if I am still in this condition, we can actually have a serious talk about what I have and where we're going to from there. And if you still want to continue to talk to me..." It's like, right now, me being young, I'm afraid to have that talk with someone. Like, I really don't want that to be out, so it's just – that's me. It's just do what I'm doing now. Just dance, have fun. I have fun doing that. My life is not boring, so... I mean, I live. I have a really good life. It's just – I'm just not ready for nobody to be a part of me right now.
00:11:33.1	HCP1	Honestly, if you're happy then that's good. I mean, and when the right time comes and the right person that you actually want to have part of your life come, then it's good.
00:11:43.0	PT	Yes, that's how I feel, because I don't...
00:11:45.0	HCP1	Do you feel like you get pressured from other people to – I mean, outside of your mom?
00:11:49.8	PT	Um, my grandma. She be – when I be up there helping her out with things, she's always asking me, "So when are you going to have you someone?" I'm like, "Granny, please. I don't – why do you keep asking me that?" I'm like, "Grandma, you know my condition as well. I don't want to have that conversation with nobody right now. I'm too young. I'm scared." And she was like, "Oh, I understand" – and yadda yadda yadda.
00:12:10.2	HCP1	Well if you do, like, meet somebody and you want help getting that conversation, we are here.
00:12:14.7	PT	Okay.
00:12:15.9	HCP1	Now, open up – under your tongue. Do you have pictures – I mean, do you have any videos of you dancing?
00:12:30.2	PT	Um, yeah, we have a lot of videos on YouTube, actually.
00:12:51.5	HCP1	I'm going to have you take a deep breath. Can you lay back for me? Did you eat breakfast today?
00:13:41.3	PT	Um, no I didn't.
00:13:45.1	HCP1	No breakfast and no lunch?
00:13:46.1	PT	No. I woke up, and as soon as I woke up, I was like, I'm going to be late. I forgot – because I forgot what time I set my appointment. I thought I set it to 2:00, but when I got here, they said it wasn't until 3:00 – but I still wanted to make sure I was here on time.
00:13:59.6	HCP1	Well, thank you for that. All right, and since we're going to – I'm going to have – I'm going to get your number. I mean, I'm going to get your number because I want to make sure that we have the right number in case MedCard asks me for a new number – anything crazy like that. What is your phone number?
00:14:15.1	PT	[XXXX]
00:14:23.4	HCP1	Okay. So XXXX, what I'm going to ask is if you could give me a little bit of urine – just a touch. So, plan... We're going to research back on your medication. I want you back in two weeks.
00:14:38.8	PT	Okay.
00:14:40.3	HCP1	Two weeks.
00:14:42.0	PT	Okay. So, um – so what does that mean today on, like – now they're starting me back on the medication today?
00:14:48.7	HCP1	Yeah, I'm going to call – we're going to call MedCard, figure out why you didn't get your meds – and get that figured out. I want you to start – start back on them. Um, I want to see you in two weeks, because we want to make sure that you're not resistant, and I want to make sure that your viral load is going down. If it's not going down, then it could mean that you're resistant and we have to start another medication, which obviously I hope that's not the case. Um, is there anything – is there anything else?
00:15:18.4	PT	No, that was basically it.
00:15:19.7	HCP1	Do you need condoms? Anything like that?
00:15:21.9	PT	Um, no. I mean, that would be helpful if you guys have some.
00:15:25.5	HCP1	Well, absolutely.
00:15:26.5	PT	What condoms do you guys have, though? Because there's a certain kinds that I'm only allowed to use.
00:15:30.8	HCP1	I don't know, but I will [00:15:31.2]. And they know all the different types of condoms. Um, and so what I'm going to ask from you is that you put a little bit of urine, and after you go to the – after go do the sample, if you could just put it in this bag, and all this will go down with you to the fourth floor when you're done.
00:15:50.0	PT	The lab? [00:15:51.0]
00:15:52.5	HCP1	Yep, all of it's going to go.
00:15:55.0	PT	Okay, because I never did that part before.
00:15:57.3	HCP1	You know, why don't we do three weeks?
00:15:58.0	PT	Three weeks?
00:15:58.6	HCP1	Three weeks, not a month. I want you back in three weeks.
00:16:02.0	PT	So like, February when? Like the 8th of February? Is that what that is?
00:16:07.4	HCP1	I think middle of February – the middle of February. That way I can see how you're doing on the meds after a month, okay?
00:16:12.8	PT	Okay.
00:16:15.6	HCP1	I think that's it. Is there anything else that you need from me? Condoms. Three weeks. I'll send Irving in quickly, and we'll call MedCard and make sure that everything's okay. For future – look on your bottle. It'll say what your pharmacy is and what the number is. Call them and be like, where is my med?
00:16:30.1	PT	Yes, I will most definitely do that.
00:16:34.7	HCP1	But all right. Here. Are you able to go right now?
00:16:36.7	PT	Yes, I can do it.
00:16:40.2	HCP1	All right. Do this, and then it'll go right in here, and I will see you, okay?
00:16:43.4	PT	Okay.
00:16:44.4	HCP1	Good luck with the dancing. I mean, when you're famous, can you, like, let us know so we can look you up?
00:16:49.1	PT	Yes, no problem.
00:16:50.8	HCP1	And I'll be like, I can't say I know you, because obviously – but I'll be like, I've seen him before in real life. I'll say that.
		00:17:04.3 – 00:18:36.0 BREAK IN CLINICAL INTERACTION
00:18:36.0	HCP2	Hey, how are you?
00:18:36.7	PT	I'm fine. How are you?
00:18:39.1	HCP2	My name is Jay. I'm one of the social workers. Therese said to give you those, and then was there anything else that you needed?
00:18:46.3	PT	Um, I'm just waiting on the lady with that – with the recording thing.
00:18:49.8	HCP2	I will let her know that you're done, and then you're all set, okay?
00:18:51.8	PT	Okay. Thank you so much.
00:18:53.0	HCP2	What is your first name again?
00:18:54.6	PT	XXXX.
00:18:55.5	HCP2	That's it. Okay. I'm just like – sorry about that. Thank you. I'll let her know. Thank you.
