(000:00)CHW: 	Counselor 108.  Family 377.  It is March 24th and we’re working on session 1.  So that’s like what I’ll say, before I =

(000:12) [crosstalk]

(000:19)CHW:	Well, and if any questions do come up, I’m happy to answer them as best that I can =

(000:23)CG:	Okay.

(000:25)CHW:	= or I can find out from other people the answers.

(000:27)CG:	Okay.

(000:31)CHW:	So, today, what we’ll do, so we’ll talk a little more about the program approach =

(000:32)CG:	Okay.

(000:41)CHW:	= and then I’d like to meet with each of you separately.

(000:44)CG:	Alright.

(000:46)CHW:	And then at the end we’ll all meet together and talk again.  And then the last thing that we’ll do today—is we’ll do your first weigh-in for the program.

(000:57)PT:	Okay.

(000:58)CHW:	Okay.  So the first thing is kind of about the, the approach that we take with this program, and so we like to use kind of a really team-based approach.  So like Xxxx, the program’s focused on helping you, but, well, and I’m coming, kind of as an outsider, a counselor, and I have a lot of information and knowledge that I can share from our program, but also you and your mom will be working really close together every day.

(001:35)CG:	Yes, we will.

(001:37)CHW:	So it’s just really important that we kind of keep that, that teamwork kind of idea in mind, us all working together as much as we can share with each other during our sessions, that’ll make them really productive, too.  Cool…,yeah, so what questions, well, how does that sound to you guys?

(002:03)CG:	It sounds good.

(002:05)CHW:	Okay.

(002:06)CG:	How it sound to you, Xxxx?

(002:11) [crosstalk]

(002:32)CHW:	So what questions do you guys have about =

(002:35)CG:	Well, we maybe, it’s kind of a hard thing, because I don’t even know how you all are going to help us because we need somebody to actually is able to come in and, and you know, we actually make a plan together on dinner or a l-, you know what I’m saying?  And get some lunch together, some, you know, we need more hands-on than it is to talk about it.

(002:57)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(002:58)CG:	You know what I’m saying?  Sometimes, you know, it’s just like all types of kind of people, and we just one of the ones, we need that extra care, really extra care where it’s hands-on where you be in here in the kitchen with us and actually we prepare a meal together.  You know?

(003:12)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(003:13)CG:	And discuss it, and whatever, but =

(003:14)CHW:	Okay.

(003:16)CG:	I don’t know.  So I don’t know how, what is it that you actually going to do.

(003:19)CHW:	Right.  Okay.  Well, that is a really good question, and that’s a lot of what we’ll talk some more about today.

(003:25)CG:	Mm-hmm.  Okay.

(003:26)CHW:	So I can tell you, just kind of right now off the bat we, so =

(003:34)CG:	Don't do it.

(003:37)CHW:	Mmm, no, we can.

(003:40)CG:	Oh, really?

(003:42)CHW:	So there’s, so we do do a lot of talking, and each week we’ll talk about a new skill, but also there’s a lot of sessions where we can include that hands-on stuff.

(003:51)CG:	Oh, thank you!  That’s what we need!

(003:54)CHW:	So

(003:56)CG:	That’s what we need.  I have a lot of books, but you know—I have a lot of low-calorie books and, ‘cause I, me, myself been dieting ever since the age of 16 good (up just mmm).  And bothering her to the fullest, thatn maybe that’s why she might have even gained the weight because I been staying on her so much, “Watch it, watch it, watch it,” =

(004:15)CHW:	Wow.

(004:15)CG:	= even from a kid that you know, maybe I should have left her alone, and she could have done it, you know,  just by outside playing and doing her own thing, but I put myself on her.  You know what I’m saying?

(004:27)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(004:28)CG:	So that may be the reason why she gained weight, but I have a lot of books, but it just seems like it’s just, I don’t know, maybe me and her get even like get together and actually look at a recipe and do it together.  You know, that could be an idea for me and her.  ‘cause she’s 

(004:45)CHW:	Are you rolling your eyes?

(004:46)CG:	She’s a 14-year-old.  Everything is a battle with me and her.

(004:52)CHW:	[laughs]

(004:54)CG:	Look at her. [laughs] Can you tel- [laughs]

(004:57)CHW:	Yeah [laughs]

(004:59)CG:	Got her a membership for us to go to the spa together.  I had to pay her to go.  You know, it’s just, I don’t know what to say, but hopefully you can help us because she seems to like it better when there’s outside help to give the attention.

(005:18)CHW:	Okay.

(005:19)CG:	You know what I’m saying?

(005:20)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(005:21)CG: 	That’s the way it seems to be for her.

(005:24)CHW:	Yeah.  Yeah, so sometimes it can be helpful to have kind of other =

(005:28)CG:	Right.

(005:29)CHW:	= perspectives and other ideas and stuff like that.

(005:31)CG:	Yeah.  

(005:32)CHW:	Cool.

(005:33)CG:	Ooh, your nose.  You got (another tissue, baby)?

(005:34)PT:	{0:05:36}

(005:37)CG:	Okay.

(005:38)CHW:	Cool.  So well, and it sounds like you have a lot of resources and things that you’ve been looking up and learning stuff, too.

(005:51)CG:	Right.  Right.

(005:52)CHW:	That’s good.

(005:53)CG:	But the thing of it is is to put it into action.

(005:58)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(005:59)CG:	You know, because it’s just not a quick fix.  It’s not a quick fix, and that’s what I’ve seem to have done always—the protein diets, the li—the Atkins diet, the this, that, that and this, but she’s agreed.  Someone at her age—do you think the Atkins diet is appropriate for her?  Or is that, you think it might be—’cause all it really is is a low carbohydrate type diet.

(006:23)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  Yeah, so that’s a big thing that we actually talk about in this program.

(006:28)CG:	Okay.

(006:29)CHW:	Is—so, the big thing is to be careful with diets, and so like programs that market themselves as like, “You’re going to lose 30 pounds in one week” =

(006:40)CG:	Mmm, which is too fast.

(006:43)CHW:	Right, so you’re saying that it seems like it’s too fast.

(006:45)CG:	Well, 30 pounds in one week, I know it is, but uh, but =

(006:48)CHW:	Right.

(006:49)CG:	= but you really can lose 15 pounds in two weeks with Atkins.  For real.

(006:56)CHW:	Oh, okay.  So what we always talk about is a lot of times those programs you might be able to lose that weight, but you’ll gain it right back.  So the approa- =

(007:04)O:	(Get results)

(007:05)CG:	Right.

(007:06)CHW:	Right, so that’s the approach of this program is being able to lose that weight and do it healthily and keep it off.

(007:11)CG:	And keep it off.  We game.  We are game.  We game, Xxxx?  We’ll even do it that way, right, Xxxx?  Right, Xxxx?

(007:22)O:	Are you from Wayne State?

(007:23)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(007:24)O:	What you majoring in?

(007:26)CHW:	Well, I’m not a student there.  So I’m just working with this program that they have.

(007:33)O:	So you haven’t graduated.

(007:35)CHW:	Yeah, I graduated from Michigan State in 2009.

(007:41)O:	{0:07:44}, if you don’t mind me asking.

(007:45)R	Yeah, so I actually studied international relations, so like international politics.

(007:52)O:	What the hell you got to do with weight though?

(007:54)CHW:	[laughs] Yeah, so =

(007:56)O:	[laughs]

(007:58)CHW:	= within that, I specialized in health policy.

(008:02)O:	Oh, okay.

(008:04)CHW:	So that’s kind of been my work experience has been within health.

(008:09)O:	So you in that field.

(008:11)CHW:	Right.  And this program gave me a lot of training.

(008:14)O:	Alright.

(008:16)CHW:	So.  Yeah.

(008:19) [crosstalk]

(008:29)CHW:	Yeah, so if it’s alright, I’ll meet with Xxxx?

(008:33)CG:	Yeah, you going to meet with Xxxx.  

(008:34)PT:	{0:08:35}

(008:36)CG:	In other words, you trying to get rid of me.

(008:37)CHW:	[laughs]

(008:38)CG:	Okay.  Alright.  ‘cause I do it all the time with me and your daddy.  Okay, we through, I'm through, 'til you’re ready for me.

(008:44)CHW:	Okay.  Cool.  So yeah, the first thing I want to ask you about is just if you can tell me some more about yourself.

(008:53)PT:	Like what?

(008:55)CHW:	[laughs] Like, you know, things you like to do, what grade you’re in.

(009:01)PT:	I’m in eighth grade.

(009:02)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(009:07)PT:	I don’t know what I like to do.  Oh, Saturdays I like to go places with my friends.  And …

(009:15)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(009:16)PT:	I used to like to cheer, but it was too much.

(009:19)CHW:	It’s too much.

(009:21)PT:	I want to be in gymnastics and that’s it.

(009:26)CHW:	Okay.  So you’re in eighth grade.  What school do you go to?

(009:31)PT:	[school name]

(009:32)CHW:	Oh, okay.  I know that one.  And then, that’s actually right by our offices.  Well, but and then you said you used to cheer.  Okay.  And you did gymnastics, or you’d like to?

(009:49)PT:	I did before, =

(009:50)CHW:	Oh, you did.

(009:51)PT:	= and I want to do it again now.

(009:52)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Cool.  So they have those programs at your school?

(009:58)PT:	 Oh, no they had it—they had it at, when I was a cheerleader, we had to do that before our competition and we had did it for like three months, and I liked it, but then I stopped because I stopped cheering, so I wouldn’t do it again.  I don’t want to cheer again.

(010:15)CHW:	Oh, okay.  So cheer isn’t something you want to do again, but gymnastics?  Okay.  Where were you able to do that?  Gymnastics?

(010:23)PT:	I don’t know the name of it.  It was a long time ago.

(010:27)CHW:	Oh, okay, so when you were younger.

(010:29)PT:	Mm-hmm.

(010:30)O:	It was some place out on 14 Mile.

(010:33)CHW:	Oh, okay.

(010:34)O:	Mm-hmm.  It was 14 {0:10:38}.  I’m not for sure.

(010:41)CHW:	Okay.

(010:42)O:	But I know it was 14 to 20.

(010:44)CHW:	Okay.

(010:45)O:	Now, her mother might be able to tell you what the name of it is.

(010:47)CHW:	Alright.  Cool.  Nice.  So then, how do you feel about your weight right now?

(010:58)PT:	Mmm, I wish it was lower.

(011:04)CHW:	Okay.  So you wish it was lower.  So kind of losing some weight is something you’re interested in doing.

(011:13)PT:	Yeah.

(011:14)CHW:	Okay.  So what makes that something that’s important to you?

(011:23)PT:	I don’t know.  I just do.  I just do.

(011:28)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  Okay.  So that’s just something that you really feel like would help you out and make you feel better, =

(011:37)PT:	Yeah.

(011:38)CHW:	= things like that.  Okay.  And what kinds of things have you tried in the past to help like manage your weight?

(011:51)PT:	I used to go to a gym and, yeah, that’s it.  I used to just go to the gym.

(012:00)CHW:	Okay.  So you used to go the gym.  Was that close by?

(012:04)PT:	Oh, it, no ‘cause it’s—it was on 12 Mile, somewhere.  I don’t know but it was a Fitness Gym.  No, it wasn’t.  What was the name of that gym?  Oh, yeah, it was Fitness USA.

(012:18)CHW:	Fitness USA.  Okay, cool.  So you’d go to the gym.  What were some of your, the things you like to do there?

(012:25)PT:	I used to like to swim, and I did water aerobics sometimes.

(012:29)CHW:	Okay.

(012:30)PT:	And, I used to work out on some of the machines.  And I did some {0:12:33}.

(012:33)CHW:	Okay.  Cool.  So that’s the water?  I like to swim, too.  I just took a swimming class last year ‘cause I couldn’t swim.  [laughs]  But now I like swimming.  And water aerobics and some of the machines.  So, but you don’t go to the gym anymore?

(012:56)PT:	Mm-mm.

(012:58)CHW:	Okay.  So what kind of made you stop doing that?

(013:03)PT:	Oh, like, they did move, like they was shut down.  They moved to this new one.  And the one I think that we went to, like, I didn’t like that one.  It just felt different, so I didn’t like that one.

(013:16)CHW:	Oh, okay, so they moved, and you didn’t really like what they changed to.

(013:20)PT:	Yeah.

(013:21)CHW:	Okay.  And then, so it sounds like you’ve done some things in the past, and there’s some activities that you really enjoy doing, some that you want to try doing again, like gymnastics.

(013:44)PT:	Uh-huh.

(013:46)CHW:	Maybe swimming?  Yeah?  Okay.  Cool.  And, I guess what’s your—what motivates you to want to lose some of the weight?

(014:05)PT:	Well, I don’t know, I guess it would be better for me, and like, I could do a lot more things because, and like get more stuff that I wanted.  ‘cause like, some of the clothes that I want, like, they’re not in my size, so I can’t get it and you know?  

(014:21)CHW:	Okay.  So it sounds like your health is important to you, and you want to be able to do some things that might not be as easy right now, and fit into some clothes that you’re not able to right now.  Okay.  Cool.  Those are all good motivations, I think.  Definitely.  And then how much do you know about what we’ll do in the program or what kinds of things we’ll work on?

(014:48)PT:	Eating right?  And um…yeah, eating right.

(014:57)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  Yeah, so we’ll focus—this program focuses on two main areas, so one of them is eating right, so eating healthier, stuff like that.  And then also we’ll talk about physical activity recommendations and guidelines.  So, like, the first two weeks we’ll meet with a dietitian, and so she’ll bring a lot of information about healthy eating, and those physical activity guidelines, and she’ll help you make a plan for you to use for the rest of the program.  And then after that, we’ll work on—each week, we’ll work on building a new skill.  So whether it’s being able to figure out how many calories you’re eating or how many calories you’re burning with physical activity and things like managing feeling hungry or cravings, and just using some other skills to be able to manage those things.  So we’ll meet twice a week, and the program goes for six months.  So what we’ll do is the first time we meet in the week, we’ll learn the new skill, and then the second time, we’ll do like a review so you have a little time to do some practice with the new skill.  And I think that’s it.  And then, well, and every time we’ll meet, you and your mom, we’ll meet together.  Okay.  Cool.  So how’s that all sound?

(016:36)PT:	Good.

(016:38)CHW:	Good?  Awesome.  What questions can I answer for you about the program?

(016:45)PT:	I don’t have any questions.

(016:46)CHW:	Okay.  And I know your mom was saying it’d be helpful to have, like, hands-on stuff.  So what do you think about doing more hands-on things in our sessions?

(016:59)PT:	Yeah, that’s good.  I like {0:17:00} things.

(017:02)CHW:	That sounds good?  Okay.  Cool.  Yeah, ‘cause when we talk about, like, physical activity recommendations, we can do some practice, like we can demonstrate some activities in the session.  There’s a cooking session that we can do and stuff like that.  Cool.  So then, the last thing—so each week what we’ll do is we’ll make a plan for what we’ll do and what we’ll work on.  This is the plan for the first week.  So thinking about what your plan is to do.  So, like you were talking about, you wanted to lose some weight, eat healthier, oh, and why you wanted to do that, so getting healthier and being able to do things, fitting into clothes.  And then this week we want to kind of think about what barriers or what things might get in the way for meeting twice a week.  So if you have extracurricular activities or stuff like that.  And then after that, we’ll do the bottom.

(018:17)PT:	{0:18:17} and get some tissues.

(018:19)CHW:	Okay.

(018:24) [pause]

(018:36)O:	{0:18:36}

(018:38)CHW:	What’s that?

(018:40)O:	{0:18:40}

(018:42)CHW:	Oh, that’s alright.

(018:47)O:	{0:18:48} a whole lot of fried foods {0:18:50} 

(018:51)CHW:	Oh, that’s good.  That’s a lot healthier way to cook it.

(018:55)O:	Yeah.  I don't cook all that fried.

(019:05)PT:	Okay, so what do you mean by planning these two?

(019:08)CHW:	Yeah, so for this program, what’s your kind of, what’s your overall plan?

(019:14)PT:	To l- =

(019:15)CHW:	That you want to accomplish?

(019:16)PT:	= to lose weight.

(019:18)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  

(019:19)[pause] 

(020:34)CHW:	Oh, and do you have any brothers and sisters?  Okay.  The little guy right here =

(020:39)PT:	That was my nephews.

(020:40)CHW:	Nephews?  Okay.  Are they older or younger?

(020:45)PT:	All of them are older than me.

(020:46)CHW:	They’re all older.  Okay. 

(020:48)[pause] 

(021:05)CHW:	Alright, so then something about then, if something is going to get in the way, then what’s something that we could try?

(021:14)PT:	If what gets in the way?

(021:18)CHW:	So like for example, some of the teens I work with, they’re in other programs, so like if their other program gets in the way, then we can try to meet at different times, or stuff like that.

(021:34)PT:	The only thing I do is tutor.

(021:36)CHW:	Okay.  Yeah, so that could be one, so if tutoring gets in the way, then what days do have tutoring now?  Or =

(021:46)PT:	Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

(021:48)CHW:	Okay.

(021:50)PT:	So

(021:52)CHW:	So we can try and not meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. [laughs] Or what time are you done tutoring?

(022:01)PT:	Six.

(022:03)CHW:	Okay. 

(022:05) [pause] 

(022:34)CHW:	Alright, so then the bottom is, so the first step that I can take in order to reach my goal.  So it’s something that you can do, like this week, to help you start working toward your goal.

(022:46)PT:	I don’t know.  I don’t know what I can do.

(022:46)CHW:	Okay.  So you’re not really sure what a first step could be.  Okay.  So no, let’s see, your plan is to lose weight.  So the two things that we always talk about in this program are, so increasing physical activity and reducing the number of calories that you take in.  So like some people {0:23:26} for the first step, like try not to eat much junk food anymore or like trying to snack less or trying to ride their bike more this week or like little things.

(023:44)PT:	Cool.

(023:45)CHW:	So like a small, small step that you could try. 

(023:47) [pause] 

(023:58)CHW:	Cool.  Yeah.  And how do you think you can be more active this week?  What do you think are some things you could do?

(024:14)PT:	I don’t know.

(024:28)CHW:	Okay.  So now you’re saying you like doing gymnastics and swimming, so those things might not be that easy to be able to do this week, but what other activities do you like to do?

(024:47)PT:	I like to go outside and ride my bike.

(024:55)CHW:	Okay.  Yeah.  So you’ll be walking around outside and riding your bike, things like that.  Cool.

(025:02)PT:	So what else should I write then?

(025:08)CHW:	Well, so is one of those—you want to try to do one of those more this week?

(025:12)PT:	Probably ride my bike more.

(025:14)CHW:	Okay.  Cool.  Yeah, add that. 

(025:16) [pause] 

(025:37)CHW:	Awesome.  So and then this spot is to think about, so like something that your family, or a friend, mom, dad, brother, sister, so something that somebody could do to help you out. 

(025:42)[pause] 

(026:22)CHW:	Awesome.  Yeah, that’s good.  Cool.  So I think you have a good plan.  And definitely starting out and for this first week.  So when we come back together with your mom, how would you feel about sharing this with her?

(026:40)PT:	Mm-hmm.

(026:41)CHW:	Is that alright?  Okay.  Cool.  So now I’ll meet with your mom, and then after that we’ll come back together and do your first weigh-in.

(026:47)PT:	Okay.

(026:48)CHW:	Alright. 

(026:50) [pause]

(027:07) [crosstalk]

(027:16)CHW:	Alright. So the first thing I wanted to ask you was how you feel about Xxxx’s weight?

(027:25)CG:	I … I mean, what do you mean like?  What do you mean how I feel about it?  Just?

(027:37)CHW:	Yeah.

(027:38)CG:	What?  [laughs]

(027:39)CHW:	Yeah [laughs]

(027:41)CG:	I mean what?  [laughs].  I mean I would like to see her be smaller, I mean, you know, because of her age and, you know, and I know what comes with it, but =

(027:48)PT:	Channel nine.

(027:49)CG:	How’d you find it?  

(027:51)CHW:	[laughs]

(027:52)CG:	But she the best.  She the best.  Honest to God.  Thanks, Xxxx.  I looked over and over and over and I didn’t see it.  You know, just only, just for like, you know, for health reasons.   Just to keep her in a—you know, not to be so overweight.

(028:09)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  Okay.  So you’re really thinking about her health =

(028:11)CG:	Yeah, the health.

(028:12)CHW:	= for her age, =

(028:13)CG:	Yeah, right, right.

(028:15)CHW:	= and stuff like that.  

(028:16)CG:	Mm-hmm.

(028:17)CHW:	Okay.  So that sounds like that’s really important for your family is to be healthy.

(028:22)CG:	Yeah, definitely.  ‘cause I know what happens.  I mean, my God, all the stuff, medication he has me on now is just ridiculous, you know.  And  I just don’t want my baby to go through that.

(028:32)CHW:	Oh, okay.  So you have some experience with  =

(028:32)CG:	Cl-  What does it say?  Cholesterol?  High blood pressure, you know, this stuff, and so (shoot).  And then that comes from the weight because you know if you get rid of the weight, then your body, you know, so.

(028:47)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(028:49)CG:	And I just don’t want her to experience, ‘cause right now, she’s healthy, you know, don’t have any issues other than having this, like sinus, and, you know, some of this stuff comes from the food that, you know, that she’s eating that she shouldn’t be eating and whatever, too.

(029:02)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(029:04)CG:	So {0:29:04}.

(029:05)CHW:	Okay.  So you really don’t want to see her go through the same thing =

(029:09)CG:	Right.  Right.

(029:10)CHW:	Same kind of things.

(029:11)CG:	Yeah, definitely.

(029:13)CHW:	And it sounds like changing some things that she’s eating =

(029:15)CG:	Yes.

(029:16)CHW:	= can be important, too.

(029:17)CG:	Yeah.  Definitely.  

(029:19)CHW:	Okay.

(029:20)CG:	Yep.

(029:21)CHW:	Cool.  And then, so I know you were saying you’d really like to see, like, some hands-on stuff.

(029:32)CG:	Right.

(029:34)CHW:	And I was wondering what, what kinds of things you guys have tried in the past to help, like, manage weight or stuff like that.

(029:41)CG:	Nothing, really.  You know with = 

(029:45)[interruption]

(031:19)CHW:	That’s nice.  You guys live close by your other rel- =

(031:22)CG:	Oh, my grandkids?  Yeah, they all around.  They all around.  But he doesn’t, he doesn’t live that close to me, so.  

(031:29)CHW:	Oh, okay.

(031:31)CG:	Yeah, my God.  

(031:33)CHW:	[laughs]

(031:34)CG:	(Hello).  And my husband, he just a nut.  Lovable as he can be, but he can be a real nut.  Honestly.  But yeah, what was we saying?  Oh, I was just going to tell you that I hadn’t really tried anything on her but tried exercise so far because—and then I will try to get foods in here, like we’ve been eating like um, but you know what?  With that kind of stuff you go over into the—it’s more eating.  Like I bought the Atkins, like I’ll buy the Atkins, like, you know, different little things to snack on, trying not to buy candy versus the fact of eating something like that.

(032:10)CHW:	Right.

(032:12)CG:	So I try to slip little things in if I find something that she likes.

(032:14)CHW:	Oh, okay.

(032:16)CG:	Yeah.

(032:17)CHW:	So you’ve been kind of like testing?

(032:18)CG:	Right.  Right.  =

(032:19)CHW:	{0:32:18} things.

(032:21)CG:	= I kind of like try to slip things in there, you know, and try to even do a little research of like what foods would like, like instead of eating chips or something, and if {0:32:30} and then she wants something to chew on, maybe a Slim-Jim.

(032:35)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(032:36)CG:	You know what I’m saying?  So just a little odds and ends, little things I try to slip in there on her ‘cause you can see Xxxx very stubborn.  So it’s uh, she—I wonder where she got that from?  But she got it from her daddy, I’ll say that.

(032:48)CHW:	[laughs]

(032:50)CG:	So, it’s like, it’s and I can’t, and with her, you can’t be too pushy because with the pushy then she really will—well, we just go the other way around.

(032:59)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  Right.

(033:01)CG:	So I’m trying with her.  You know, she—I have to, I try to—I’ll pay her.  You know what I’m saying?  

(033:07)CHW:	[laughs]

(033:08)CG:	I do.  I pay Xxxx.  I pay her to go to the spa, you know, “If you go to the spa, then I give you twenty dollars if you stay in the aerobics class at least three days out of the week, I’ll give you twenty dollars.”  She loves money.  So I say, “I’ll give you twenty dollars if you do it.”  [laughter] and but, and then I had her doing, it’s so good, we was doing the water aerobics.  Excellent.  And why did the one that we go to clo—the one we was going to close?

(033:34)CHW:	Yeah.  She was saying that.

(033:35)CG:	You know what I’m saying?  I mean I got her into it.  She actually doing her thing in the water.  Finally.  I mean I finally hooked her, and they move.  And now it’s all—we have to go all the way down here on 12 Mile and Woodward.  You know what I’m saying?

(033:50)CHW:	That’s the next closest.

(033:51)CG:	It’s just it’s so much for me to do to take one son to work, pick the grandkids up, then go way down there, pick her up, but I got to bring the grandson back because the mom and daddy got to get him, and so for me to come all the way back home—and she go to school right there at [school] down there on {0:34:10}?  

(034:11)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(034:12)CG:	We just a few blocks from Wood- we were actually jump on, you know, Woodword and go straight there?  I have to come all the way back with the grandson for my son to pick him up, so it’s like, ugh.

(034:23)CHW:	Right.  That’s a lot to juggle.

(034:26)CG:	I had a (nerve).  I went out and bought us a tape for us to exercise in the living room, you know, which, no, that is not working.  I made a mistake and they was—her and my son’s girlfriend was exercising in the living room.  They had the wrong tape.  They had the two-mile tape.  Well, they had the two-mile tape [laughter] which they did give up on exercising because they had—instead of doing the one-mile that they were supposed to be doing =

(034:52)CHW:	They were doing two.

(034:53)CG:	= something to try {0:34:52} [laughter] 	They were doing the two-mile, and nobody wants to even look at the tape now, you know, so I’m like uh-uh, so. [laughs]  I try.  I try with her.  I try.  But she said she was willing this time because she ready to start high school.

(035:10)CHW:	Oh, okay.

(035:12)CG:	So she, you know, so she say she was going to—she would try something—she say “we” will—she said me and her.
 
(035:17)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(035:18)CG:	So I’m saying, “Yes, I’ll try, too.”

(035:19)CHW:	Okay.  So she’s really willing to do it with you helping her out?

(035:24)CG:	Yeah.  She said she was willing this time, so we’ll see.

(035:27)CHW:	Okay.  And high school is a motivator.

(035:30)CG:	Yeah, really, high school, I think.  ‘cause that is—ugh.  And my thing is that kids can just be so cruel.  They can be so cruel.  Oh my God.  Kids can be so cruel, and I just don’t want nobody to, you know—and she don’t know that because she hasn’t experienced high school.  She been so lucky ‘cause her going to school and being overweight.  She thinks all the children love her and you know, so she been lucky, you know, doing good with that.  So even so her being herself, hopefully that’s just what a person would actually see.

(036:05)CHW:	Right.

(036:06)CG:	You know, see her and not think about that.  So far, so good.  It’s been good for her.

(036:11)CHW:	Okay.  That’s good.  So she has a supportive school environment right now.

(036:16)CG:	Right, right.  

(036:18)CHW:	That’s good.

(036:19)CG:	That [school name] has been excellent for her, yeah.

(036:21)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(036:22)CG:	Excellent school.  So, but I do.  I just hope that me and her both do it.

(036:29)CHW:	Yeah.  Well, I think, you know, you’re both taking the first step =

(036:34)CG:	Yeah.

(036:35)CHW:	= and, it sounds like you both have some really strong motivations.

(036:38)CG:	Yeah.  She sounds like it now?

(036:41)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(036:42)CG:	Oh, God.

(036:43)CHW:	I think so.

(036:44)CG:	Oh, God, ‘cause that’s where it has to come from ‘cause there’s nothing I can do.  I can’t make her.  You know, I can’t make her.  It’s got to be in herself to want to do it.  I can’t, I can’t make her.  You know, so.  Oooh, I just hope she—if she do, I’m just willing to go 100 with her.

(037:00)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(037:02)CG:	Whatever we got to give—whatever material—whatever you can do to help us out—we want to be one of the families that, when you talk about it, that we actually did it, you know.

(037:12)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(037:13)CG:	We actually did it.  That’s what we want to do.

(037:15)CHW:	Okay.  Awesome.

(037:16)CG:	Yeah.

(037:17)CHW:	I like that, you know, I like you’re—I can see you’re, like, energized.

(037:21)CG:	Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever, whatever, whatever, ‘cause I just—you know, that’s been my praying. I’ve got to get off this medication.  I’ve got to get—it’s just too much.  I had a father that had a tableful—it was like a little round table like what you would put out in the backyard?

(037:36)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(037:37)CG:	Full of medication.  You know, full of medication.  And half of it he might not have even had to need, you know, or whatever, but for back in the day he probably didn’t even need all of that, you know?

(037:48)CHW:	Right.

(037:49)CG:	And all that medication, and I just refuse it.  I’m not going to be taking no medication all of my life.

(037:55)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(037:57)CG:	All of my life taking no medication.  It’s just not going to be.  And I don’t want my baby to experience it at all, so whatever.

(038:06)CHW:	Right.

(038:08)CG:	We really, we, hey.

(038:10)CHW:	Yeah, so.

(038:11)CG:	You help us.

(038:12)CHW:	[laughs]

(038:13)CG:	You help us.

(038:14)CHW:	Okay.  So you have some strong motivations, too.  You want to try to get off some medications and =

(038:18)CG:	Oh, yeah.  I want off.  

(038:20)CHW:	= get healthier.

(038:21)CG:	I want off.  I’m telling you—off.  I want off of it.  I’m serious.

(038:27)CHW:	Yeah.  So then for the program—for our sessions, what do you already know about what we’ll be doing?

(038:36)CG:	Well, I think the most that is the only thing really being said is that you would help us with—I don’t know if it’s suggestions of things that we can do and if you have any type of—like, we were mentioning something about exercise that if—I don’t know if there’s something that you know something that—I don’t know if we can—I don’t know ‘cause I don’t know what actually do you all—are you all capable of doing to help us?

(039:05)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(039:07)CG:	I know to come and talk to us and talk to us, but what can you really do to help us?  I don’t really know, =

(039:12)CHW:	Right.  Okay.

(039:14)CG:	= you know, what you can really do.

(039:16)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  Okay.  So, the first two sessions that we do—well, I’m sorry, the first two weeks what we’ll do is we’ll be meeting with a dietitian.

(039:27)CG:	Oh, okay.

(039:28)CHW:	So she’ll have a lot of information about healthy eating and things like that, and also physical activity guidelines and recommendations =

(039:36)CG:	Okay.

(039:37)CHW:	= and she’ll actually help Xxxx to create her own plan for =

(039:42)CG:	Oh, great.

(039:43)CHW:	= for like, her calories and =

(039:45)CG:	Oh, yes.

(039:46)CHW:	= nutrition and stuff like that.

(039:47)CG:	Oh, that’s what I’m talking about.  Okay, yeah.

(039:49)CHW:	And then that’s the plan that we’ll work from for the next six months.

(039:53)CG:	Okay.

(039:56)CHW:	So we’ll meet twice a week =

(039:57)CG:	Okay.

(039:58)CHW:	= for those six months.  And then each week, so after the first two weeks when we meet with the dietitian, then each week we’ll work on learning a new skill.  So whether that’s, so like we do calorie counting and something called environmental control to help with food triggers and things like that.

(040:22)CG:	Mmm.

(040:23)CHW:	Managing hunger and cravings, so things like that.  And then within all those things, there are hands-on things that we can do.

(040:31)CG:	Okay.

(040:32)CHW:	So like when we learn about physical activity guidelines, we can do some, some demonstration and practice and figure out how many calories you can burn by doing X, Y, Z.

(040:42)CG:	Okay.

(040:44)CHW:	And there’s other sessions we can do, like healthy cooking and things about eating out and all that stuff.

(040:51)CG:	Okay.

(040:55)CHW:	Oh, and then, so the first time we meet =

(040:56)CG:	Don’t be trying to get {0:40:57}.  Don’t go all the way away.  Where you going?  

(041:00)PT:	{0:41:00}

(041:02)CG:	It’s not your turn yet.  It’s {0:41:01}.  Okay, well, just stay close by.  

(041:04)PT:	Oh, I wasn’t going.

(041:06)CG:	Oh, okay.  Yeah. [laughter]

(041:09)CHW:	So the first time we meet in the week, we’ll learn about the new skill, and then the second time we’ll do, like, a review, so you guys have some time to try out the new skill and practice =

(041:21)CG:	Okay.

(041:22)CHW:	= putting into place.

(041:23)CG:	Okay.

(041:25)CHW:	And each week we’ll make a change plan, so with some goals that you want to work on for the week and what things can help you get there.

(041:30)CG:	Mm-hmm.  That makes me want to cry.  I believe it can work.  I just believe it could help us.  I do.  I believe it can help us.  I do.  I just, I just do.  It’s got to be a change ‘cause I know to lose weight for me all the years—that have just been up on a yo-yo, up and down, that I have learned that the secret is not all those quick, fast diets, but the secret is the actual, just eating right.  ‘Cause everything was put on this Earth the Lord gave us to, that we have the right to eat, but it’s all about actual portion, and it’s about just some exercise.  I mean even if it’s just a little walk.  Man, it wasn’t how I took for granted with the walking that when you get out there—I’m serious—and I’m going to say—I don’t care, I’m going to say how much I weigh—270 pounds—and you try to take and carry 270 pounds when you walking.  It’s not a joke.  And then one day as you start to lose the weight and you finally be able to like to take that walk, you appreciate that walk.  When the water rose, I used to think “Oh, that’s nothing because I can do it in the water.”  But, you know, actually, even that, just to have the wind to be able to do it—that’s taken for granted because I’m telling you, it’s no joke with this weight.  She don’t know because she young, but I can see that when she walks from the school to where I park, she’s out of breath, and she don’t realize, and I’m trying to tell her, “That’s weight.  That’s not asthma, that’s not—you know, it’s weight.  It’s carrying that weight, and it tires you out.”

(043:17)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(043:18)CG:	That weight carri- it tires you out.  It’s just.  It’s awful.  It’s just an awful thing.  It really is.  It’s just nothing good about it.  And I just ain’t never going to give up, myself ‘cause I’m me, and I’m going to lose this weight.  I don’t care how old I am by the time I finally do it, but I’m going to conquer that in my life ‘cause I’m not going to carry this weight.  It’s too much.  It’s too much.  Trying to come down the steps and it’s so embarrassing.  Trying to come down the steps and you can’t even come down—and I didn’t realize this stuff, you know what I’m saying?  It’s like it’s just like it’s all of a sudden is I can just—it’s like when I come down, and the type of person that I am.  {0:44:00} the neighbor sitting on the porch.  I don’t feel like I’m that old and I need to be coming down those steps sideways.  But you can’t bring that weight down—now you got some that can, but I can’t.  It’s too much on my knees for me to say one step at a time just to come down and stuff and carry all of this with you.  It’s just not a joke.  It’s not a joke.  It’s really not, and I’m {0:44:24}.  I’m going to run down the steps, and I’m going to run up ‘em.  Run down and run up ‘em.  I am.  

(044:32)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(044:33)CG:	It’s not and I just don’t, and I love my child, and I just don’t want her to have those same things.

(044:37)CHW:	Mm-hmm.  Mmm.

(044:43)CG:	Mm-hmm.  Where you going with that purse? 

(044:47)PT:	Huh?

(044:48)CG:	Where you going with your purse?

(044:49)PT:	Got to put my money in it.

(044:50)CG:	Oh, okay.

(044:51)PT:	He gave me 10 dollars.

(044:52)CG:	You gave you 10 more dollars?  

(044:53)PT:	Yeah.

(044:55)CG:	Oh, shoot.  I need to see {0:44:56}.

(044:57)CHW:	[laughs]

(044:58)PT:	(Now I got 60.)

(044:59)CHW:	Tell Xxxx I say, “Come here.”  I want you to meet my oldest son.  We all got a weight issue, but he been doing pretty good lately, so.

(045:08)CHW:	Okay.

(045:09)CG:	But he—we are, we are, and I mean that’s why—you know, I’m going to get her—she like that boy’s bike, but I might—she can keep it as long as she can ride it, you know, I let her go and ride it, but I mean, I try to get her just to—for us, me and her to just take a walk.  And back in the day when I was a child, my mother used to cook dinner for us, and then she would pop some popcorn and just take us for a walk.  You know what I’m saying?  Just, and all that was just so wonderful, things like that.  And so now I try to do “Xxxx, come on let’s, Xxxx,” but, no, you know, we just jump in the car for everything.  You jump in the car to go to the store.  You jump—everything.  The store’s just right there on the corner.  Why we can’t walk to the—you know, but you jump in the car for everything, so…but, I’m—some of those old things, old things that you used to do when you was a kid you kind of need to have kept, you know, keep doing it.  Now I know why she was taking us for a walk after dinner.  Burning those calories that we ate.

(046:11)CHW:	Yeah, that’s smart.

(046:12)CG:	‘Cause I wasn’t a fat kid.  Let me show you something.  [laughter]  {0:46:16} real quick.  Real quick.  I don’t know how much you supposed to—you know.  I just want to show you something.  Let me show you.  And this is a guy right here—well, I don’t really have to show him.  But I’m going to show him in a minute, though. Wait.  Just wait.  My son right here—you see him right there?  

(046:46)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(046:47)CG:	Now he was what?  Oh, I don’t know.  He was a young fellow ‘cause right now he like 22.  He 100 pounds lighter.  

(046:54)CHW:	Oh, wow.

(046:55)CG:	I should show you him, he’s a little handsome, but he was a fat little kid though.  See, and then, but look—this is me.  Isn’t that nice? 

(047:04)CHW:	Ahh. [laughs]

(047:06)CG:	Isn’t that nice?  That’s how I was when my husband met me.  That hurts me.  That hurts me.  When I see this picture here and I just look at it—even though it wasn’t like I was skinny, but I just hadn’t did what I’m doing now, you know.  Look at this.  This is how I was.  That was—you know, it wasn’t until—I don’t know what happened.  But I just wasn’t meant to be as big as {0:47:29} we going on me.  I’m sorry.  Go ahead.  Let’s go head out.

(047:32)CHW:	No, that’s okay.  I think—I mean, I think it’s really great.  You have, like, the right mindset, I think.

(047:37)CG:	Okay.

(047:38)CHW:	I think it’s good.  And you know, you =

(047:41)CG:	This is Xxxx when she was little.

(047:42)CHW:	Oh, yeah. [laughs]

(047:44)CG:	There’s Xxxx.

(047:47)CHW:	I think it’s really great that, you know, you’re saying you really love Xxxx and you want to help her out =

(047:52)CG:	Yes, Lord.

(047:54)CHW:	= and I mean and you see it as something that can help you, too, so I think that’s really great that it’s something you guys can take on together and =

(048:04)CG:	Yeah.

(048:05)CHW:	= and I really think you have the right ideas for getting it done. =

(048:08)CG:	She said she was.  She said she was.  She told me she would do it this time, ‘cause actually, her—when I see her, the bad habits that me and her sometime we do together, and I know habits are hard to break, so but she said she was willing to try it, so.

(048:27)CHW:	Yeah.

(048:30)CG:	Let’s just see.

(048:32)CHW:	Yeah.

(048:33)CG:	Let’s see what happens.

(048:35)CHW:	[laughs]

(048:36)CG:	Let’s see.

(048:38)CHW:	Umm

(048:39)CG:	Did I talk you too much?  I’m sorry, ‘cause I am a talker.

(048:41)CHW:	No, that’s okay.  It’s good.  I mean, it’s really helpful to be able to share lots of information.

(048:46)CG:	Oh, okay.

(048:47)CHW:	So, the last thing, so this is an example of—so we’ll make a change plan each week.

(048:54)CG:	Okay.

(048:55)CHW:	So for our first week, we just want to make a plan around, so what your plan is to support Xxxx.

(049:02)CG:	Everything.

(049:03)CHW:	Why it’s important to you to do that.

(049:05)CG:	Mm-hmm.

(049:07)CHW:	And then thinking about if things can get in the way of meeting twice a week and then what we could try if things get in the way.  And then lastly, the first step that you can take in order to help, help Xxxx out.

(049:25)CG:	Okay.  What?  You want me to do this now?

(049:28)CHW:	If that’s okay.

(049:29)CG:	Oh, man.  I don’t know.

(049:33)CHW:	[laughs]  So there might be some homework with this program.

(049:36)CG:	Can I do this homework?  

(049:37)CHW:	[laughs]

(049:38)CG:	I got to do it now?  Or when you come back have it?

(049:41)CHW:	Well, so I guess, also if you have, if you know the answers already, that’s just something we’ll talk about when we all come back together, ‘cause Xxxx also made a plan that she wants to share with you. 

(049:57) [pause]

(050:35)CHW:	Alright.  So then when we come back together we’ll, I’ll have you guys share your plans with each other.

(050:41)CG:	Oh, okay.

(050:42)CHW:	And then we’ll talk some about scheduling.  And then we just have to do the first weigh-in.

(050:42)CG:	Okay.  Okay.

(050:49)CHW:	So.

(050:50)CG:	So you, so when do you—you don’t know right now when you’ll come back or?

(050:53)CHW:	Yea, so that’s what we’ll talk about next.

(050:56)CG:	Okay.  Do we need to do that now so we know you coming back next week, or what?

(051:06)CHW:	Yeah.  Well, so before we do that, we’ll meet with Xxxx again =

(051:13)CG:	Okay.

(051:14)CHW:	= and talk about the plans.

(051:15)CG:	Okay.  One minute.  Xxxx!  Xxxx!  Come on!  Come on, Xxxx!  Come on!  {0:51:32} anyway.  She ready to get outside and play.  Well, not play.  {0:51:45}  I don’t know what they were … Where your daddy go?  Your daddy came?  

(051:55)O2:	He down the street.

(051:56)CG:	He down the street? 

(051:57)PT:	{0:51:57}

(051:58)CG:	He down the street with who?

(051:59)PT:	I don’t know.  Somebody.

(052:01)CG:	Ugh.  You okay?

(052:09)CHW:	Alright.  So what do you guys think about sharing your plans with each other?

(052:12)CG:	Go ahead.

(052:13)CHW:	Alright.  So do you want to start?

(052:18)PT:	What?  What?  I’m supposed to read it?

(052:20)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(052:22)PT:	Well, my plan is to lose weight.  I want this so that I can do more things such as play sports without getting tired.  I also want to do this so I can find more things in my size.  If this gets in the way, tutoring, then I have to try not meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday before six.  The first step that I can take in order to reach my goal is to be more active and to ride my bike more.  Something my friends could do to help me reach my goal is to ride their bikes with me.  

(053:03)CG:	Very good.  Well, my plan to support you is everything I can do.  Whatever it is that we need to do.  Be very cooperative and whatever I can do, I’m just willing to do it.  And I want to do it for health, for health reasons.  I want to help you for health reasons so that you don’t have to suffer everything and go through what I go through.  And, I feel like nothing’s going to get in our way because what we going to do is schedule at the times that we know that those are the days that we don’t have anything to do.  And I feel like the first step to reach—what’d I say?  The first step that I can take in order to reach my goal is take the first step, acknowledge it is one of the first things we can do is to learn more so that we can do better.  That’s what I wrote.

(054:00)CHW:	Yeah.  Awesome.  So thanks for sharing those.  And I was telling your mom, I think you guys have the right mindsets, and I think you have some really good, some good motivations.  And I think, you know, definitely if you guys can work together on the plans that you make that I think you guys will definitely be a really successful family in this program.  Definitely.

(054:25)CG:	We are.  We going to be one of the families that you going to be able to say, “I had this one family, and they were ready to go.  They were anxious and willing, and they did it.”  Right, Xxxx?  ‘Cause we winners, right?  We winners, Xxxx?

(054:39)PT:	{0:54:43} [laughter]  

(054:45)CG:	{0:54:47} winners.  I think she just do that to me on purpose.  I really do, but we winners.  We are winners.  We’re victorious.  We’re going to do it.

(054:58)CHW:	Yeah.

(054:59)CG:	We’re going to do it.  We going to look back at my baby, she going to be—when I go whooo!  And I mean, we just going to go—you talk about clothes shopping, sister.

(055:06)PT:	Whatever.  You give me all this stuff that I don’t want to go places with.

(055:11)CG:	No—well, what, you know, guess what?  Remember you know that once we be able to get inside a store that has those things that you want, you can get whatever you want.

(055:18)PT:	Whatever.

(055:19)CG:	Come on now.

(055:20)PT:	No.

(055:20)CG:	Come on.

(055:21)PT:	Already asked you could I get something and you was like, “That’s too much.”

(055:24)CG:	And what and you- but come on now.  Now this is going to be a treat.  This is something to look forward to.  This is something that the money that we spend on all those snacks we could put in a jar.

(055:33)PT:	What snacks?

(055:34)CG:	Like the way we eat snacks?  You know how we sit up in the bed = 

(055:36)PT:	{0:55:36}

(055:37)CG:	= and we eat snacks.  Pringles and candy and nuts and =

(055:43)PT:	You do that.  You ate mine.  I didn’t even get to eat none of ‘em.  Not even two.

(055:50)CG:	One thing of—we won’t go there.  We won’t go there.

(055:52)PT:	The whole thing {0:55:53} a whole jar =

(055:55)CG:	Like I said.  We’ll have—we’ll get us a jar.  We’ll get us a jar, and we’ll start putting money in the jar.  That’s what we’ll do.  So when it’s time, when you hit your first twenty pounds—when you hit first twenty pounds, we going shopping, even with just twenty.

(056:11)PT:	Twenty dollars?

(056:12)CG:	Twenty pounds.

(056:13)PT:	Oh.

(056:14)CG:	Twenty pounds.  That’s it.  Right there.  Twenty.  Smack twenty.

(056:20)CHW:	Yeah.

(056:21)CG:	Yeah.  We going shopping.

(056:25)CHW:	[laughs] Well, I think it’s really cool your mom, you know, she’s willing to do anything and everything to help you out.  And she’s really willing to be there for you.  So what do you think about that?

(056:37)PT:	Uh-huh.  That’s okay.

(056:41)CHW:	Okay.

(056:42)CG:	(Disrespectful.)

(056:49)CHW:	So the next thing we have to talk about is scheduling.

(056:51)CG:	Okay.

(056:53)CHW:	So this is my contact information.  And so the—and if you guys ever try to contact me, my commitment to you guys is that I’ll get back to you within twenty-four hours.

(057:08)CG:	Okay.

(057:08)CHW:	And the days that I don’t work are Friday and Sunday.  So I’m available on Saturday =

(057:16)CG:	Okay.

(057:18)CHW:	= if that helps out.

(057:19)CG:	Well, we could make an appointment now, ‘cause we know Mondays would definitely be one of our days because Monday is the day she don’t—I don’t go to school at night and whatever, too, so Mondays is off so she don’t do tutoring on Mondays, =

(057:31)CHW:	Okay, Mondays.

(057:32)CG:	= so we could do Mondays, and we can do 

(057:36)PT:	Thursdays.

(057:37)CG:	Thursdays?  Mondays and Thursdays.

(057:40)CHW:	Mm-hmm.

(057:41)CG:	For us it’d be good if it’s okay with you.

(057:43)CHW:	Okay.  So and our next session will be with the dietitian.

(057:48)CG:	Okay.

(057:50)CHW:	So I—Mondays and Thursdays, and I’ll contact her so that—‘cause I have to check what her schedule is =

(057:58)CG: 	Okay.

(057:59)CHW:	= to see if she’s available.

(058:00)CG:	Okay.

(058:01)CHW:	But then I can give you guys a call.  I don’t know if this Monday will work, but this Thursday might work, so I’ll give you guys a call before.

(058:12)CG:	Okay, okay.

(058:13)CHW:	Before then.  And then if you guys ever need to cancel a session, just 24-hours’ notice, but if it’s an emergency, we understand =

(058:23)CG:	Okay.

(058:24)CHW:	= that that won’t really be possible.

(058:26)CG:	Okay.

(058:33)CHW:	And then I think that’s all.  What questions do you guys have about any of the scheduling or anything?

(058:41)CG:	Well, that’ll be okay, so, you know, like I said, the scheduling.  We just have to make sure because before this you know we, like I said, like on Tuesday nights, I definitely—I’ll be in school from what?  Five to eight.

(058:55)CHW:	Mmm.

(058:56)CG:	So and then she on Tuesday have her tutoring and she get out at six on Tuesdays and Wednesdays is her tutoring night, which it doesn’t matter, like if you don’t mind coming after that time far as—not on a Tuesday, ‘cause that’d be eight; that’s too late on a Tuesday.

(059:12)CHW:	Right, but Wednesday.

(059:14)CG:	But Wednesday she gets out after six.  That’s okay, if that’s okay with you, =

(059:17)CHW:	Oh, okay.  Mm-hmm.

(059:19)CG:	= you know.  But it’s just those days are the days that we have that going on.

(059:23)CHW:	Right.  Okay.  Okay.  So Tuesdays, Wednesday after six and Thursday.

(059:31)CG:	Mm-hmm.

(059:32)CHW:	Okay, cool.  Cool.  So =

(059:36)CG:	Mondays also, no, that’s the best ‘cause there’s nothing on Mondays and that could be early. =

(059:41)CHW:	That’s the best.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  So then the last thing that we have to do is just the first weigh-in.  So then we’ll do a weigh-in once a week, so usually when we do the skill session, we’ll do the weigh-in.  So and we do a weigh-in each week ‘cause that helps us to keep track of your weight over time.  So and looking at your weight each week over, like, a couple of months helps us to really see kind of what things are helping or what things we can improve on.

(060:17)CG:	Now what about that, what was that $600 thing?  What—how did that go?  What was that $600 thing that she was telling us something?

(060:27)CHW:	Mmm.  Oh, that’s probably—so, af—the research team comes back in the third month =

(060:33)CG:	Uh-huh

(060:34)CHW:	= and they check to see if Xxxx’s lost 3% of her body weight or not.

(060:39)CG:	Mm-hmm.

(060:41)CHW:	And then ‘cause the second half of the program can be a little different.  So and one of the ways that it can be different is there’s an incentive program where you earn points for losing weight.  

(060:54)CG:	Oh, okay.

(060:55)CHW:	So and you can earn up over $600 in that part of the program.  But that’s all random.

(061:01)CG:	That’s what I heard—random.

(061:04)CHW:	So like it’s—it was random whether you guys would be in the office or I would come here.  And then the second part is random in to what goes next.

(061:15)CG:	Okay.

(061:17)CHW:	Yeah.  So if it’s alright, we’ll do the weigh-in now.

(061:21)CG:	Oh.  Okay.  Do I weigh in, too, or just her?

(061:25)CHW:	So, that, you’re welcome =

(061:26)CG:	No.

(061:27)CHW:	= to also do a weigh-in [laughs].

(061:28)CG:	No. [laughs]

(061:30)CHW:	So, that’s up to you if you’d like to.

(061:32)CG:	No, if I’m not—if it ain’t my turn, no.

(061:38)CHW:	Okay.  You just got to wait for the zeroes.  Okay.  Alright.

(061:53)PT:	I was 240.

(061:55)CG:	What is you now?

(061:56)PT:	236.

(061:58)CG:	Ooooh.  See that even looks good, doesn’t it?  I ain’t kidding.  I don’t care.  When I see one, if I see two pounds, I’m happy.  I want to get on there now, too, but I’m scared.  I done ate a lot already.

(062:09)PT:	You sure did.

(062:11)CG:	You don’t have to look.  

(062:12)CHW:	[laughs]

(062:14)CG:	I just doing it for myself.  I’m doing it myself, not y’all.

(062:16)CHW:	Okay, so.

(062:18)CG:	Wait, wait, I got to take off my, oh, (better) keep my sock on?

(062:25)PT:	The side don’t do nothing.
